	abstract = {The challenge of biodiversity upscaling, estimating the species richness of a large area from scattered local surveys within it, has attracted increasing interest in recent years, producing a wide range of competing approaches. Such methods, if successful, could have important applications to multi-scale biodiversity estimation and monitoring. Here we test 19 techniques using a high quality plant data set: the {GB} Countryside Survey 1999, detailed surveys of a stratified random sample of British landscapes. In addition to the full data set, a set of geographical and statistical subsets was created, allowing each method to be tested on multiple data sets with different characteristics. The predictions of the models were tested against the “true” species–area relationship for British plants, derived from contemporaneously surveyed national atlas data. This represents a far more ambitious test than is usually employed, requiring 5–10 orders of magnitude in upscaling. The methods differed greatly in their performance; while there are 2,326 focal plant taxa recorded in the focal region, up-scaled species richness estimates ranged from 62 to 11,593. Several models provided reasonably reliable results across the 16 test data sets: the Shen and He and the Ulrich and Ollik models provided the most robust estimates of total species richness, with the former generally providing estimates within 10\% of the true value. The methods tested proved less accurate at estimating the shape of the species–area relationship ({SAR}) as a whole; the best single method was Hui’s Occupancy Rank Curve approach, which erred on average by {\textless}20\%. A hybrid method combining a total species richness estimate (from the Shen and He model) with a downscaling approach (the S izling model) proved more accurate in predicting the {SAR} (mean relative error 15.5\%) than any of the pure upscaling approaches tested. There remains substantial room for improvement in upscaling methods, but our results suggest that several existing methods have a high potential for practical application to estimating species richness at coarse spatial scales. The methods should greatly facilitate biodiversity estimation in poorly studied taxa and regions, and the monitoring of biodiversity change at multiple spatial scales.},

However, estimation of the loss has focused mostly on per-species extinction rates measured over a limited number of spatial scales, with little theory linking small-scale extirpations to global extinctions. Here, we provide such a link by introducing the relationship between area and the number of extinctions (number of extinctions–area relationship; {NxAR}) and between area and the proportion of extinct species (proportion of extinctions–area relationship; {PxAR}). Unlike static patterns, such as the species–area relationship, {NxAR} and {PxAR} represent spatial scaling of a dynamic process. We show theoretical and empirical forms of these relationships and we discuss their role in perception and estimation of the current extinction crisis.},

	abstract = {Changing Assemblages
Although the rate of species extinction has increased markedly as a result of human activity across the biosphere, conservation has focused on endangered species rather than on shifts in assemblages. Dornelas et al. (p. 296; see the Perspective by Pandolfi and Lovelock), using an extensive set of biodiversity time series of species occurrences in both marine and terrestrial habitats from the past 150 years, find species turnover above expected but do not find evidence of systematic biodiversity loss. This result could be caused by homogenization of species assemblages by invasive species, shifting distributions induced by climate change, and asynchronous change across the planet. All of which indicates that it is time to review conservation priorities.
The extent to which biodiversity change in local assemblages contributes to global biodiversity loss is poorly understood. We analyzed 100 time series from biomes across Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns of temporal α diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal β diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of α diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal α and β diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species composition should be a conservation priority.
Ecological communities are experiencing changes in species composition rather than unidirectional loss. [Also see Perspective by Pandolfi and Lovelock]

	abstract = {Spatial structure of species change
Biodiversity is undergoing rapid change driven by climate change and other human influences. Blowes et al. analyze the global patterns in temporal change in biodiversity using a large quantity of time-series data from different regions (see the Perspective by Eriksson and Hillebrand). Their findings reveal clear spatial patterns in richness and composition change, where marine taxa exhibit the highest rates of change. The marine tropics, in particular, emerge as hotspots of species richness losses. Given that human activities are affecting biodiversity in magnitudes and directions that differ across the planet, these findings will provide a much needed biogeographic understanding of biodiversity change that can help inform conservation prioritization.
Science, this issue p. 339; see also p. 308
Human activities are fundamentally altering biodiversity. Projections of declines at the global scale are contrasted by highly variable trends at local scales, suggesting that biodiversity change may be spatially structured. Here, we examined spatial variation in species richness and composition change using more than 50,000 biodiversity time series from 239 studies and found clear geographic variation in biodiversity change. Rapid compositional change is prevalent, with marine biomes exceeding and terrestrial biomes trailing the overall trend. Assemblage richness is not changing on average, although locations exhibiting increasing and decreasing trends of up to about 20\% per year were found in some marine studies. At local scales, widespread compositional reorganization is most often decoupled from richness change, and biodiversity change is strongest and most variable in the oceans.
Biodiversity change in the marine realm outpaces that in terrestrial systems, and loss is most prevalent in the tropics.

We also study whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial grain of the data. Location Europe, Great Britain, Finland and Catalonia. Methods We used data on European birds, plants, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate, differences in land-cover composition ({CORINE}) and beta diversity (βsim, βJaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results Beta diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had weaker but distinct and grain-dependent effects. Climate was more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land-cover effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country-wide analyses, climate and land cover were more important than geographic distance. Climatic and land-cover models performed poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions We found that relationships between geographic distance and beta diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling should take both environment and dispersal limitation into account.},

We also tested the effect of data quality and of unequal survey periods on ΔS estimates, and checked for spatial autocorrelation of ΔS estimates. Using data from equal survey periods, we found significant increases in hoverfly species richness in the Netherlands at fine scales, but no significant change at coarser scales indicating a decrease in beta diversity. In the {UK}, ΔS was negative at fine scale, near zero at intermediate scales, and positive at coarse scales, indicating that the degree of spatial beta diversity increased between the time periods. The use of unequal survey periods (using longer periods in the past to compensate for lower survey intensity) tended to inflate past species richness, biasing ΔS estimates downwards. High data quality thresholds sometimes obscured dynamics by reducing sample size, but never reversed trends. There was little spatial autocorrelation of ΔS, implying that local drivers (land use change or environmental noise) are important in dynamics of hoverfly diversity. A second, sample agglomeration approach to measure scaling resulted in greater noise in ΔS, obscuring the {NL} pattern, while still showing strong evidence of fine-scale richness loss in the {UK}. Our results indicate that explicit considerations of spatial (and temporal) scale are essential in studies documenting past biodiversity change, or projecting change into the future.},

Here, we review the opportunities presented by biodiversity time series, and address three related issues: (i) recognizing the characteristics of temporal data; (ii) selecting appropriate statistical procedures for analysing temporal data; and (iii) inferring and forecasting biodiversity change. With regard to the first issue, we draw attention to defining characteristics of biodiversity time series—lack of physical boundaries, uni-dimensionality, autocorrelation and directionality—that inform the choice of analytic methods. Second, we explore methods of quantifying change in biodiversity at different timescales, noting that autocorrelation can be viewed as a feature that sheds light on the underlying structure of temporal change. Finally, we address the transition from inferring to forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting potential pitfalls associated with phase-shifts and novel conditions.},

	abstract = {1 There is an urgent need to understand the impacts of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on biodiversity in tropical forests, but no consensus has yet emerged. We reviewed the literature for the most frequently studied taxon (birds, 37 studies) and found that increased and decreased diversity in response to disturbance (selective logging and shifting agriculture) were reported with approximately equal frequency. 2 The spatial scale at which studies were carried out significantly affected the reported response to disturbance: studies where disturbed and undisturbed habitats were sampled at large spatial scales were more likely to report increased diversity following disturbance, whereas studies that sampled habitats at small spatial scales were more likely to report decreased diversity. These results were not a consequence of sampling method: we divided the studies into those using capture methods and those using observation methods and the same result was obtained when the analysis was restricted to only those studies using observation methods. 3 Previously, we have shown that reported impacts of disturbance on Lepidoptera are also affected by the spatial scale of study. We reviewed the Lepidoptera literature published since then and showed that all 12 new studies conformed to the predicted pattern. 4 While sampling scale significantly affected the reported responses of both birds and Lepidoptera, there were opposite effects of scale in the two taxa: large-scale bird studies and small-scale Lepidoptera studies were more likely to report increased diversity following disturbance. Bird studies were generally carried out at larger spatial scales than those of Lepidoptera and these opposite impacts of scale were probably due to a non-linear effect of habitat disturbance on habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. 5 Synthesis and applications. The rapid loss and degradation of tropical forests means that an understanding of the general patterns of responses of species to habitat disturbance is urgently needed. However, there has been little discussion of the most appropriate methods to ensure comparability of results between studies. Data presented here indicate that the spatial scale of sampling chosen in studies has a marked effect on the results obtained, and future studies need to account for this by examining explicitly the effects of disturbance at different spatial scales. The effect of spatial scale differs between taxa, and this may explain why the search for indicator taxa of disturbance effects has so far proved elusive.},

	abstract = {1 Many studies have examined the impacts of tropical habitat disturbance. However, the effects of moderate habitat disturbance on species diversity show little consensus, with both increased and decreased diversity following disturbance being reported with approximately equal frequency. Previous work has shown that the spatial scale of sampling affects the reported changes in diversity following habitat disturbance, and here we present new theoretical and empirical data which explain why this is so. 2 We assume that habitat disturbance reduces the slope of the species–area relationship ({SAR}), and we show theoretically that this reduction in the slope results in a scale-dependent response of diversity to disturbance. Thus, following moderate habitat disturbance, diversity is reported to increase when measured at small spatial scales but declines when measured at large spatial scales. Our findings suggest that even a very small change in the {SAR} slope following disturbance corresponds with a scale-dependent response of diversity to disturbance. 3 We analyse new empirical data for tropical butterflies at a range of spatial scales (≈ 3–80 ha). Our results support our theoretical findings and the notion of scale-dependence in estimates of diversity. We show that this scale-dependence occurs because α and β diversity increase with spatial scale at a significantly faster rate in undisturbed forest compared with disturbed forest. This is due to reduced habitat heterogeneity and reduced spatial autocorrelation of butterfly diversity data following disturbance. 4 Synthesis and applications. There is little consensus in the reported responses of species diversity to moderate tropical habitat disturbance, and the spatial scale at which studies are carried out largely pre-determines the findings. Here we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, the mechanisms that produce a scale-dependent response of diversity to habitat disturbance. There is little agreement among researchers about the best methods for sampling tropical species in the field, and our findings highlight the problems of using diversity changes that do not account for the spatial scale of sampling. We conclude that in the future, studies should assess spatial patterns in diversity over a range of spatial scales and should not evaluate changes in diversity at a single spatial scale.},

However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analysed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity – species richness – was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10\% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.},

Whereas there is a widespread perception that such initiatives have been unsuccessful, there are few quantitative tests of this perception. Here, we evaluate whether rates of biodiversity change have altered in recent decades in three European countries (Great Britain, Netherlands and Belgium) for plants and flower visiting insects. We compared four 20-year periods, comparing periods of rapid land-use intensification and natural habitat loss (1930–1990) with a period of increased conservation investment (post-1990). We found that extensive species richness loss and biotic homogenisation occurred before 1990, whereas these negative trends became substantially less accentuated during recent decades, being partially reversed for certain taxa (e.g. bees in Great Britain and Netherlands). These results highlight the potential to maintain or even restore current species assemblages (which despite past extinctions are still of great conservation value), at least in regions where large-scale land-use intensification and natural habitat loss has ceased.},

	abstract = {Recently, a debate has developed over how biodiversity is changing across the planet. While most researchers agree species extinctions are increasing globally due to human activity, some now argue that species richness at local scales is not declining as many biologists have claimed. This argument stems from recent syntheses of time-series data that suggest species richness is decreasing in some locations, increasing in others, but not changing on average. Critics of these syntheses (like us) have argued there are serious limitations of existing time-series datasets and their analyses that preclude meaningful conclusions about local biodiversity change. Specifically, authors of these syntheses have failed to account for several primary drivers of biodiversity change, have relied on data poor time-series that lack baselines needed to detect change, and have unreasonably extrapolated conclusions. Here we summarize the history of this debate, as well as key papers and exchanges that have helped clarify new issues and ideas. To resolve the debate, we suggest future researchers be more clear about the hypotheses of biodiversity change being tested, focus less on amassing large datasets, and more on amassing high-quality datasets that provide unambiguous tests of the hypotheses. Researchers should also keep track of the contributions that native versus non-native species make to biodiversity time trends, as these have different implications for conservation. Lastly, we suggest researchers be aware of pros and cons of using different types of data (e.g., time-series, spatial comparisons), taking care to resolve divergent results among sources to allow broader conclusions about biodiversity change.},

	abstract = {The current loss of biodiversity has been broadly acknowledged as the main cause of ecosystem change. To halt this trend, several international agreements have been made, and various biodiversity metrics have been developed to evaluate whether the targets of these agreements are being met. The process of developing good indicators is not trivial. Indicators should be able to synthesize and communicate our current knowledge, but they also need to meet both scientific and practical criteria. Since it would not be practical to monitor all species, indicators are mainly built on the monitoring of some well-known taxa, such as birds. Here we systematically review the wide spectrum of bird biodiversity indicators (hereafter indicators) available to: i) evaluate recent methodological advances; ii) identify current knowledge gaps jeopardizing indicator interpretation and use in guiding decision-making; and iii) examine challenges in their applicability across different spatial and temporal contexts. We pay particular attention to indicator characteristics such as site and species selection, spatial, seasonal and habitat coverage, and statistical issues in developing indicators and tools to tackle them, to provide specific recommendations for the future construction of indicators. Several methodological advances have recently been made to enhance the process of indicator development, including multiple ways to select sites and species to increase their robustness. However, we found that there are strong spatial, seasonal and habitat biases among the selected indicators. Most of them are from Europe, using mainly census data from the breeding season and typically covering farmland and forest habitats. The major challenges that we detected in their applicability were related to the modelling of the statistical uncertainty associated to the indicator. We recommend the use of quantitative methods in site and species selection procedures whenever possible. Current indicators should be expanded to areas outside Europe and to less studied habitats and should not neglect monitoring work outside the breeding season. Time-series analyses studying temporal trends and using multi-species data should in general account for temporal autocorrelation as well as for phylogenetic correlation. Multi-species hierarchical models are a good alternative for analysing and constructing indicators, but they need to include annual random effects allowing for unexplained annual variation in the average status of the community, i.e. the indicator target. Despite methodological and context-specific differences in the indicators reviewed, most of them seem to highlight the urgent need of devising strategic climate and conservation policies to improve the status and trends of biodiversity.},

The consequences of urbanization are mainly an increased fragmentation of the original landscapes associated with a decrease in the amount of favorable habitats and an increased pressure of human activities on the remaining patches suitable for wildlife. Patterns of bird species richness have been studied at different levels of urbanization, but little is known about the temporal dynamics of animal communities in urban landscapes. In particular, urbanization is expected to have stronger negative effects on migratory breeding bird communities than on sedentary ones, which should lead to different patterns of change in composition. Using an estimation method accounting for heterogeneity in species detection probability and data collected between 2001 and 2003 within a suburban area near the city of Paris, France, we tested whether these communities differ in their local extinction and turnover rates. We considered the potential effects of patch size and distance to Paris' center as a measure of the degree of urbanization around the patches. As expected, local rates of extinction and turnover were higher for migratory than for sedentary species, and they were negatively related to patch size for migratory species. Mean species richness of the sedentary species increased during the study period and their local turnover rate was negatively related to the distance to the urban core, showing a trend to colonize the most urban patches. These results highlight the very dynamic nature of the composition of some local bird communities in fragmented habitats and help to identify factors affecting colonization and extinction.},

At the Conference of the Parties of the {CBD} in Nagoya, Japan in 2010, the target was renewed for 2020. We have developed a Biodiversity Change Index ({BCI}) to help measure progress towards this target. The {BCI} is constructed with a two-dimensional resolution, allowing for a direct evaluation of the relative importance of changes in quantity and quality, respectively, to the overall change in biodiversity. Quantity is measured as the area of a specified habitat type and quality as the abundance of indicator species and other habitat quality parameters, such as the proportion of old trees or dead wood in forests. The {BCI} enables easy comparison of changes in biodiversity between different habitat types and between different regions and nations. We illustrate the use of {BCI} by calculating the index for the Nordic countries for two common habitat types, farmland and forest, and one habitat type of similar importance in the northern hemisphere; mires. In the period 1990–2005 declines in biodiversity of similar magnitudes are seen for farmland and mires across the Nordic countries, while for forest, trends vary considerably. Our results show that the {BCI} framework can be a useful tool to communicate the complex issue of biodiversity change in a simple manner. However, in accordance with other studies of biodiversity change we conclude that existing monitoring data are too scarce to consistently calculate {BCI} for all habitat types in all Nordic countries. In order to reasonably evaluate changes in biodiversity, further efforts towards monitoring programmes to obtain reliable and quality assured data on biodiversity at acceptable spatial and temporal resolutions are needed. Moreover, common methods to apply and harmonise data from different monitoring schemes should be developed.},

	abstract = {Partitioning biodiversity change spatially and temporally is required for effective management, both to determine whether action is required and whether it should be applied at a regional level or targeted more locally. As biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, comparative analyses of different indices, focussing on different components of biodiversity change (evenness vs. abundance), give better information than a single headline index. We model changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of British breeding birds using generalized additive models applied to count data collected between 1994 and 2011. Abundance estimates, accounting for differences in detectability, are then used in community-specific (farmland and woodland) biodiversity indices. Temporal trends in biodiversity, and change points in those trends, are assessed at different spatial scales. The geometric mean of relative abundance, a headline indicator of biodiversity change, is assessed together with a goodness-of-fit evenness measure focussing separately on the rare and common species in the communities. Our analysis reveals predominantly declining trends in biodiversity indices for farmland and woodland bird communities in southern and eastern England, perhaps signalling environmental deterioration in this part of the country. Conversely, our results also show generally more positive trends in the north of Britain, consistent with north–south gradient expectations from the effects of climate change. We also reveal predominantly positive changes in evenness for the common species and negative changes in evenness for the rarer species in the communities, consistent with previously documented homogenization in bird communities. Synthesis and applications. Bird populations are seen as good indicators of ecosystem health, and trends for different communities can be indicative of wider biodiversity changes within their respective habitats. However, temporal trends in biodiversity at the national level may miss opposing trends occurring at different locations within the nation. We develop methods that allow assessment of how temporal trends vary spatially and whether these trends differ for the rare and common species in the respective communities. Our methods may be used to test hypotheses about the processes that generate the trends.},

	abstract = {Protected areas ({PAs}) are a cornerstone of conservation efforts and now cover nearly 13\% of the world's land surface, with the world's governments committed to expand this to 17\%. However, as biodiversity continues to decline, the effectiveness of {PAs} in reducing the extinction risk of species remains largely untested. We analyzed {PA} coverage and trends in species' extinction risk at globally significant sites for conserving birds (10,993 Important Bird Areas, {IBAs}) and highly threatened vertebrates and conifers (588 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, {AZEs}) (referred to collectively hereafter as ‘important sites’). Species occurring in important sites with greater {PA} coverage experienced smaller increases in extinction risk over recent decades: the increase was half as large for bird species with{\textgreater}50\% of the {IBAs} at which they occur completely covered by {PAs}, and a third lower for birds, mammals and amphibians restricted to protected {AZEs} (compared with unprotected or partially protected sites). Globally, half of the important sites for biodiversity conservation remain unprotected (49\% of {IBAs}, 51\% of {AZEs}). While {PA} coverage of important sites has increased over time, the proportion of {PA} area covering important sites, as opposed to less important land, has declined (by 0.45–1.14\% annually since 1950 for {IBAs} and 0.79–1.49\% annually for {AZEs}). Thus, while appropriately located {PAs} may slow the rate at which species are driven towards extinction, recent {PA} network expansion has under-represented important sites. We conclude that better targeted expansion of {PA} networks would help to improve biodiversity trends.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The World Conservation Union ({IUCN}) Red List Index ({RLI}) is used to measure global trends in the status of biodiversity. We examined how the index might be used to measure the trend in the status of indigenous breeding birds in British Columbia between 1992 and 2006. We followed the {RLI} method described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2007) as closely as possible . Because {IUCN} Red List assessments at the regional level are not available in British Columbia, we used {NatureServe} S (subnational) ranking data. We calculated three index trend lines. The first two of these allowed us to compare an index based on our original data to one based on data that had been retrospectively corrected; the latter produced a smooth, flat line. A third trend line, based on the corrected data but excluding species new to province since 1947, produced a gently sloping downward trend. Ongoing immigration of bird species in and out of British Columbia added to the complexity of interpreting our regional {RLI}-type index, especially because our S-rank data did not incorporate transboundary “rescue” effects. Because the {RLI} is scaled so that the maximum value is based on a state in which all species are simultaneously ranked as least concern, it may exaggerate the highest potential status of intrinsically vulnerable species. A simpler, more intuitive graphic allows reporting that is less dependent on context. We believe the {RLI} approach holds useful innovation for an indicator of change in biodiversity within jurisdictional boundaries.},

	abstract = {The European Farmland Bird Indicator ({FBI}) has been adopted as a Structural and Sustainable Development Indicator by the {EU}. It identifies farmland bird trends and uses them as a proxy for wider farmland biodiversity health. This study analyzed the potential impacts of future Common Agricultural Policy ({CAP}) land uses on the abundances of the 20 farmland bird species included in the French {FBI}. Four agricultural policy scenarios were studied using the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact analysis ({CAPRI}) agricultural model. These four scenarios describe the most likely changes in crop areas and include regional bird population data from the French Breeding Bird Survey. A habitat association model was used to predict the potential effects that changes to five crop categories, as well as the total arable area, would have on species indices and the {FBI}. Our study demonstrates that the relative abundances of specialist farmland bird species depend on both crop cover type and the total crop area. Model predictions show a general decline in the abundance of farmland birds between 2007 and 2020. However, the loss of farmland birds is predicted to be less pronounced in the ‘{CAP} Greening’ scenario, although the predicted {FBI} values have relatively large errors. Moreover, whatever the forecasted {CAP}, such uniform agricultural changes do not affect bird populations or the {FBI} equally across all regions. The {FBI}'s geographical variability in response to applied agricultural changes clearly indicates that a nationwide policy will not yield equal results but will instead depend on where in the country the agricultural changes occur. To optimize the effectiveness of the {CAP} on biodiversity at the national and continental levels, policies should be tested at smaller spatial levels, such as regions or farmlands, and then, the policies that represent the best options for biodiversity at these sublevels should be combined to create a national plan.},

	abstract = {The current headline indicator for ecosystem health and sustainability incorporates a geometric mean of relative abundances of breeding birds. Recently, a family of diversity measures (λ-measures) has been proposed as a novel instrument to separate diversity trends in dominant and rare species. This makes them an ecologically informative complement to current composite diversity indices. Using both a geometric mean and the set of λ-measures, we study habitat-specific temporal trends in the diversity of British breeding birds. The analysis employs abundance estimates corrected for variation in detectability between individuals from different species to reduce bias. Applying generalized additive models, we predict long-term trends. We locate significant changes in these diversity trends. While the geometric mean reveals overall diversity trends by habitat type, supplementing these by the λ-measures provides a more nuanced picture of trends: a positive trend in the geometric mean may hide predominantly declining trends among the rarer species, which is then revealed by trends in the λ-measures. Synthesis and Applications. Bird populations are seen as useful indicators of the health of wildlife and the countryside because they occupy a range of habitats, they tend to be towards the top of the food chain, and data is provided by long-term surveys. Hence, many countries apply wild bird indicators ({WBIs}), quantifying trends in biodiversity, to monitor environmental health. The {UK}'s {WBI}, for example, has become one of the government's headline indicators of sustainable development. Understanding the population changes underlying the estimated trends is indispensable if we are to allocate limited resources more effectively. Employing a novel set of measures alongside the traditional geometric mean index, we analyse diversity trends among British breeding birds. It reveals that species that are scarce, but not yet in the focus of conservation action, may be the ‘losers’ in biodiversity action plans. This suggests that additional resources should be devoted to species showing long-term decline before they reach the low population levels that currently trigger large-scale species-specific rescue projects.},

	abstract = {Growing concern about the fate of biodiversity, highlighted by the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010 and 2020 targets for stemming biodiversity loss, has intensified interest in methods of assessing change in ecological communities through time. Biodiversity is a multivariate concept, which cannot be well-represented by a single measure. However, diversity profiles summarize the multivariate nature of multi-species datasets, and allow a more nuanced interpretation of biodiversity trends than unitary metrics. Here we introduce a new approach to diversity profiling. Our method is based on the knowledge that an ecological community is never completely even and uses this departure from perfect evenness as a novel and insightful way of measuring diversity. We plot our measure of departure as a function of a free parameter, to generate “evenness profiles”. These profiles allow us to separate changes due to dominant species from those due to rare species, and relate these patterns to shifts in overall diversity. This separation of the influence of dominance and rarity on overall diversity enables the user to uncover changes in diversity that would be masked in other methods. We discuss profiling techniques based on this parametric family, and explore its connections with existing diversity indices. Next, we evaluate our approach in terms of predicted community structure (following Tokeshi's niche models) and present an example assessing temporal trends in diversity of British farmland birds. We conclude that this method is an informative and tractable parametric approach for quantifying evenness. It provides novel insights into community structure, revealing the contributions of both rare and common species to biodiversity trends.},

In this study, we quantified and compared temporal changes in the abundance, taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of bird assemblages, using roadside monitoring data of the North American Breeding Bird Survey from 1971 to 2010. We calculated 12 abundance and diversity metrics based on 5-year average abundances of 519 species for each of 768 monitoring routes. We did this for all bird species together as well as for four subgroups based on breeding habitat affinity (grassland, woodland, wetland, and shrubland breeders). The majority of the biodiversity metrics increased or remained constant over the study period, whereas the overall abundance of birds showed a pronounced decrease, primarily driven by declines of the most abundant species. These results highlight how stable or even increasing metrics of taxonomic, functional, or phylogenetic diversity may occur in parallel with substantial losses of individuals. We further found that patterns of change differed among the species subgroups, with both abundance and diversity increasing for woodland birds and decreasing for grassland breeders. The contrasting changes between abundance and diversity and among the breeding habitat groups underscore the relevance of a multifaceted approach to measuring biodiversity change. Our findings further stress the importance of monitoring the overall abundance of individuals in addition to metrics of taxonomic, functional, or phylogenetic diversity, thus confirming the importance of population abundance as an essential biodiversity variable.},

	abstract = {Volunteer-based standardized monitoring of birds has been widely implemented in Europe and North America. In France, a breeding bird survey is running since 1989 and offers keen birdwatchers to count spring birds annually during 5 min exactly on 10 fix points within a randomly selected square. The first goal of such breeding bird surveys is to measure temporal trends in order to detect possible species declines. Combining annual indices of species sharing ecological affinities or a protected/red list status further provides biodiversity indicators for policy makers. Because the sampling effort is similar among sites, and because the initial selection of monitored sites is random, the temporal trends can be considered representative of national trends, and spatial comparisons of the obtained metrics are possible. Species abundance, community richness but also community specialization and average trophic level can be estimated for each site and each year and further related to the wide range of habitat and landscape characteristics and to agricultural or forestry practices. The large number of sites allows overcoming the opposition between adaptive and passive monitoring, making such schemes fitted to adaptive monitoring. This provides opportunities to determine which type of management or practices favour biodiversity. The comparison of population fate or community dynamics across a wide range of climates and temperatures, e.g. from southern to northern Europe, revealed how European birds are already affected by climate change. Bird communities are shifting northwards, but at a slower rate than temperatures, while bird populations have larger growth rates away from their hot thermal limit. Finally, such large-scale long-term monitoring data on a complete taxonomic group (Aves) is original and offers the opportunity to compare different measures of biological diversity, such as taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity. Such a citizen science scheme is an efficient scientific tool (numerous papers published in international peer-reviewed journals) which is furthermore highly cost-effective, with a reduced permanent staff in a state insitution coordonating the network and analysing the data, while a similar survey conducted by state staff only would cost more than one million euros annually. The future development of bio-economic dynamic models for providing scenarios of sustainable farming and logging to maintain biodiversity will further highlight the necessity of such volunteer monitoring for policy makers and decision planning. Scientific and logistic partnerships could be proposed to help developing such a monitoring scheme in China.},

The red-list assessment done by Finnish authorities of species in Finland is taxonomically one of the most extensive national assessments. We used the Finnish Red Lists from 2000 and 2010 to calculate for the first time the national {RLIs} for 11 taxonomic groups at different trophic levels and with different life cycles. The red-list index is calculated on the basis of changes in red-list categories and indicates trends in the status of biological diversity of sets of species. The {RLI} value ranges from 0 to 1. The lower the value the faster the set of species is heading toward extinction. If the value is 1, all species in the set are least concern and if the value is 0, all species are (regionally) extinct. The overall {RLI} of Finnish species decreased. This means that, in Finland, these taxonomic groups were heading toward extinction faster in 2010 than in 2000. Of the analyzed groups of organisms, {RLIs} of 5 decreased and {RLIs} of 6 increased. At the national level, the {RLIs} and status trends varied markedly between species groups. Thus, we concluded that generalizations on the basis of {RLIs} of a few taxa only may yield a biased view of ongoing trends in the status of biological diversity at the species level. In addition, one overall {RLI} that includes many different species groups may also be misleading if variation in {RLI} among species groups is not considered and if {RLI} values are not presented separately for each group.

We quantify the relative importance of both processes by modelling annual variation in population growth of 18 farmland bird species in the {UK} as a function of measures of land-use intensity and weather. Modelled together, both had similar explanatory power in accounting for annual fluctuations in population growth. When these models were used to retrodict population trends for each species as a function of annual variation in land-use intensity and weather combined, and separately, retrodictions incorporating land-use intensity were more closely linked to observed population trends than retrodictions based only on weather, and closely matched the {UK} farmland bird index from 1970 onwards. Despite more stable land-use intensity in recent years, climate change (inferred from weather trends) has not overtaken land-use intensity as the dominant driver of bird populations.},

	abstract = {Aim Describing the spatio-temporal dynamics of biotic communities is critical for understanding how environmental change can affect biodiversity. Mountains are especially susceptible to such changes (e.g., climate change) and, consequently, have been identified as ecosystems of conservation concern. With their sharp physical and ecological transitions, altitudinal gradients allow examining the influence of different climatic conditions and land use types on species assemblages across small spatial extents, and thus, they constitute natural laboratories to study diversity–environment relationships. Location Switzerland. Methods We take advantage of long-term (20 years) monitoring data and an extensive trait dataset (100 traits) to examine spatial patterns, temporal trends, and spatio-temporal dynamics in functional and beta diversity of bird communities in the Swiss Alps. Results Functional diversity indices showed a congruent pattern over time and across space; most indices decreased over the study period and were strongly correlated with altitude. In agreement with studies from the tropics, we found that communities in the lowlands were functionally over-dispersed, whereas communities at higher elevations were functionally clustered. High-altitude communities exhibited high functional originality, low levels of niche differentiation and a high turnover rate. Beta diversity declined over the study period. Conclusions Our findings suggest that pastoral abandonment does not result in an increase in avian functional diversity as most species colonizing woody-encroached grasslands are functionally redundant, whereas alpine meadows are inhabited by species exhibiting a high degree of habitat specialization and unique functional traits. Hence, the tree line constitutes a boundary between two well-differentiated functional groups: one representing a functional continuum from lowlands dominated by agricultural landscape to high-mountain forests, and the other one composed of alpine communities. Overall, this study reveals a process of biotic homogenization (i.e., increasing functional similarity) across the last two decades in the Swiss Alps, coinciding with the recently reported increases in the abundance of generalist species.},

	abstract = {Given a resource gradient (e.g. light intensity, prey size) in a community, species evolve to use different parts of this gradient; competition between them is thereby reduced. Species relationships in the community may be conceived in terms of a multidimensional coordinate system, the axes of which are the various resource gradients (and other aspects of species relationships to space, time, and one another in the community). This coordinate system defines a hyperspace, and the range of the space that a given species occupies is its niche hypervolume, as an abstract characterization of its intra-community position, or niche. Species evolve toward difference in niche, and consequently toward difference in location of their hypervolumes in the niche hyperspace. Through evolutionary time additional species can fit into the community in niche hypervolumes different from those of other species, and the niche hyperspace can become increasingly complex. Its complexity relates to the community's richness in species, its alpha diversity. Species differ in the proportions of the niche hyperspace they are able to occupy and the share of the community's resources they utilize. The share of resources utilized is expressed in species' productivities, and when species are ranked by relative productivity (or some other measurement) from most to least important, importance-value or dominance-diversity curves are formed. Three types of curves may represent manners in which resources are divided among species: (a) niche pre-emption with strong dominance, expressed in a geometric series, (b) random boundaries between niches, expressed in the {MacArthur} distribution, and (c) determination of relative importance by many factors, so that species form a frequency distribution on a logarithmic base of importance values, a lognormal distribution. The forms of importance-value curves do not permit strong inference about resource division, but are of interest for their expression of species relationships and bearing on measurement of diversity.},

Here we present a method for producing indices based on the {IUCN} Red List to chart the overall threat status (projected relative extinction risk) of all the world's bird species from 1988 to 2004. Red List Indices ({RLIs}) are based on the number of species in each Red List category, and on the number changing categories between assessments as a result of genuine improvement or deterioration in status. The {RLI} for all bird species shows that their overall threat status has continued to deteriorate since 1988. Disaggregated indices show that deteriorations have occurred worldwide and in all major ecosystems, but with particularly steep declines in the indices for Indo-Malayan birds (driven by intensifying deforestation of the Sundaic lowlands) and for albatrosses and petrels (driven by incidental mortality in commercial longline fisheries). {RLIs} complement indicators based on species population trends and habitat extent for quantifying global trends in the status of biodiversity. Their main weaknesses are that the resolution of status changes is fairly coarse and that delays may occur before some status changes are detected. Their greatest strength is that they are based on information from nearly all species in a taxonomic group worldwide, rather than a potentially biased subset. At present, suitable data are only available for birds, but indices for other taxonomic groups are in development, as is a sampled index based on a stratified sample from all major taxonomic groups.},

The {RLI} for the world's birds shows that that their overall threat status has deteriorated steadily during the years 1988–2004 in all biogeographic realms and ecosystems. A preliminary {RLI} for amphibians for 1980–2004 shows similar rates of decline. {RLIs} are in development for other groups.

However, further application of the {RLI} (to non-avian taxa in particular) has revealed some shortcomings in the original formula and approach: It performs inappropriately when a value of zero is reached; {RLI} values are affected by the frequency of assessments; and newly evaluated species may introduce bias. Here we propose a revision to the formula, and recommend how it should be applied in order to overcome these shortcomings. Two additional advantages of the revisions are that assessment errors are not propagated through time, and the overall level extinction risk can be determined as well as trends in this over time.},

At the Conference of the Parties of the {CBD} in Nagoya, Japan in 2010, the target was renewed for 2020. We have developed a Biodiversity Change Index ({BCI}) to help measure progress towards this target. The {BCI} is constructed with a two-dimensional resolution, allowing for a direct evaluation of the relative importance of changes in quantity and quality, respectively, to the overall change in biodiversity. Quantity is measured as the area of a specified habitat type and quality as the abundance of indicator species and other habitat quality parameters, such as the proportion of old trees or dead wood in forests. The {BCI} enables easy comparison of changes in biodiversity between different habitat types and between different regions and nations. We illustrate the use of {BCI} by calculating the index for the Nordic countries for two common habitat types, farmland and forest, and one habitat type of similar importance in the northern hemisphere; mires. In the period 1990–2005 declines in biodiversity of similar magnitudes are seen for farmland and mires across the Nordic countries, while for forest, trends vary considerably. Our results show that the {BCI} framework can be a useful tool to communicate the complex issue of biodiversity change in a simple manner. However, in accordance with other studies of biodiversity change we conclude that existing monitoring data are too scarce to consistently calculate {BCI} for all habitat types in all Nordic countries. In order to reasonably evaluate changes in biodiversity, further efforts towards monitoring programmes to obtain reliable and quality assured data on biodiversity at acceptable spatial and temporal resolutions are needed. Moreover, common methods to apply and harmonise data from different monitoring schemes should be developed.},

A total of 1,464, 1,713, and 1,708 individual birds and 130, 131, and 144 total species were detected in forest, abandoned cacao, and managed cacao, respectively. Independent of season, cacao habitats had a significantly greater number of individuals and species per point than forest. Community similarity analyses based on guild categorizations revealed a significant degree of similarity among all habitats; however, habitat affinity analyses showed cacao habitats having significantly less forest specialists than forest. A multiple linear regression model for actively managed cacao habitat using habitat and landscape variables revealed density and diversity of canopy tree species to be significantly correlated with numbers of forest specialist species detected per point. Although nearest distance to forest was negatively correlated with the number of forest specialist species per point, it was not a significant variable in the model, possibly indicating the complex and unpredictable nature of bird movements within the complex habitat mosaic of Talamanca. The present forest bird community of the Talamanca lowlands is poor in forest specialist species relative to other forested Caribbean lowland sites. The broad patterns of avifaunal distribution illustrated by our results suggest, therefore, that although cacao plantations cannot substitute for forest, they provide habitat for a large number of species which depend to some degree on forests.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The composition and structure of the bird community were investigated in French Guiana (northeastern Amazonia) 1 year and 10 years after selective logging and compared with bird community composition and structure in undisturbed primary forest. A point-count method was used in which 937 0.25-ha sample quadrats were censused for 20 minutes each. Whereas logging removed little more than 3 trees/ha, 38\% of the forest undergrowth was destroyed and a proportion of the canopy was opened or damaged. An overall 27–33\% decrease of species richness, frequency, and abundance occurred after logging, with a less marked decline of diversity and evenness indices, a substantial increase in the proportion of dominant species, and a 45\% difference in species composition, weighed by frequency, between logged and undisturbed forest communities. Forty-two percent of the species from the primary forest decreased sharply or disappeared after logging and only 34\% increased or remained unchanged. Microhabitat selection was the main correlate of sensitivity to disturbance. Most affected by logging were species associated with the understory of tall mature stands especially terrestrial species, members of mixed flocks, and solitary sallying insectivores, all of which decreased by 70\% to over 90\%. Most birds associated with canopy, small gaps, and vine tangles declined by only 10–30\%. Small frugivores and species associated with clearings or edges increased. Among other factors, physiological intolerance of understory species to open forest microclimatic conditions (light, heat, or water stress) might influence their avoidance of logged areas. Timber harvesting generated a high level of disturbance, which depressed the bird diversity. After over 10 years of regeneration, the dense regrowth produced a uniform habitat type that still had not recovered the high species richness exhibited by the primary forest under an intermediate level of disturbance.},

	abstract = {Timber concessions cover 90\% of forest on some Indonesian islands, but the effects of logging on endemic-rich island avifaunas are poorly known. I used a point count method to estimate population densities of Seram’s lowland birds in recently logged forest and in unlogged forest. Few bird species were excluded from logged forest, and several species were similarly common in the two habitats. Bird species diversity (the Shannon index) was, however, significantly lower in logged forest. The proportion of Seram’s species that declined after logging was comparable to that reported from species-rich continental areas. There were also some similarities in the types of birds most affected. Species that were rare in unlogged forests were no more likely to decline after logging than were common ones. Although birds with small global ranges fared no worse than widespread species, several endemic forms were seriously affected. So many of the region’s taxa are endemic to single islands that logging concessions need to be examined at an individual island level and the presence or absence of endemic forms of susceptible genera considered. Cambios en la Abundancia de Aves Después de Tala Selectiva en Seram, Indonesia Cerca del 90\% de los bosques en ciertas islas Indonesias están concesionados a compañías madereras, pero se conoce poco de los efectos de la tala sobre la avifauna rica en endemismos asociada a estas islas. Utilicé un método de conteo por puntos para estimar las densidades poblacionales de las aves de tierras bajas en Seram, en bosque talado recientemente y en bosque no talado. Pocas especies de aves fueron excluidas del bosque talado, y varias especies fueron similarmente comunes en los hábitats. Sin embargo, la diversidad de aves (mediante Índice de Shannon) fue significativamente menor en el bosque talado. La proporción de especies de Seram que declinaron después del talado fue comparable a la reportada para áreas continentales de alta riqueza de especies. También hubo similitud en el tipo de aves más afectadas. Las especies raras y comunes en bosques no talados tenían la misma posibilidad de declinar después del talado. Aunque las especies con pequeños rangos de distribución global no corrieron peor suerte que las especies de amplia distribución, hubo varias formas endémicas que fueron afectadas seriamente. Debido a que muchas taxa de la región son endémicas a una sola isla, las concesiones madereras deben ser examinadas a nivel individual, y se debe considerar la presencia o ausencia de formas endémicas.},

	abstract = {Little of Brazil's remaining Atlantic forest is protected, so it is important to assess how well the region's wildlife can persist in areas/habitats outside reserves. We studied bird diversity and abundance during 546 point counts in the Sooretama/Linhares reserve, 200 point counts in 31 forest fragments (10–150 h), and 50 point counts in {\textless}30-year-old Eucalyptus plantations, within 7 km of the reserve. Only eight bird species were recorded in Eucalyptus, and this impoverishment, as compared to some Eucalyptus plantations elsewhere in Brazil may be a result of intensive clearance of understory vegetation. Species diversity in forest fragments was significantly lower than in the reserve. Twelve, mostly non-forest or edge species, were significantly commoner in the fragments, but nineteen species were frequent in the reserve but rare or absent in forest fragments. These included two Pyrrhura parakeets, a Brotogeris parakeet, a trogon Trogon, a jacamar Galbula, woodpeckers Piculus and Campephilus, Myrmotherula antwrens, and Hemithraupus and Tachyphonus tanagers. Bird species richness at points in forest fragments did not decline with fragment size, distance from the reserve, or forest quality. However, forest in fragments was more heavily degraded than forest within the reserve and poor forest quality may be the cause of declines in some species. Whilst protection of forest within reserves is a priority, management of forest fragments may aid conservation of some threatened species.},

We sampled birds in undisturbed and disturbed forest islands in regenerating forests and in four replicates of each of the following man-made habitats: arboreal agricultural habitats (cacao, coffee, mixed, citrus and allspice), non-arboreal agricultural habitats (corn, jalapen{\textasciitilde}o chili pepper and bananas), live fences and pastures, at Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. We censused 22145 birds representing 226 species. We detected 79\% of the species in forest habitats, 80\% in agricultural habitats, 43\% in live fences and only 5\% in pastures. Isolating distance and continued disturbance by humans of forest fragments were important variables influencing species' richness. Arboreal agricultural habitats and live fences were richer in species and in birds than non-arboreal man-made habitats. Economic surveys showed that some of the crops investigated yield higher returns than cattle ranching based on pastures. We discuss the conservation value for birds of agricultural islands and of live fences as landscape elements that help reduce physical and biotic isolation among remaining configurations of forest fragments in Los Tuxtlas.},

The first axis of a detrended correspondence analysis of floristic lists from twenty vegetated plots was strongly positively correlated with estimates of time since gardening, canopy height and cover, total basal area of stems greater than 3 m in height, leaf litter, and total concentrations of S, C and N in the top 5 cm of soil. Grass cover, soil {pH} and available K were negatively correlated. Burning of slashed secondary forest was found to increase to soil P, available Ca, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, S, C and N to levels in primary forests. Bird, butterfly and reptile species diversity increased along the successional gradient. This response was least marked with reptiles. Niche breadths of these faunal groups decreased with later successional stages. The primary forests support birds which are specialist feeders, particularly frugivores, nectarivores and branch gleaners. Obligate granivores were restricted to a grassy early successional plot, which was identified as an outlier in the analysis and which had atypical soil attributes. A substantial number of plant species was restricted to, or occurred in, early successional stages, in contrast to the small proportion of animal species that used such sites. This may reflect a long history of intermediate disturbance (i.e. forest gaps) and relatively little widespread disturbance. This specialization renders the fauna vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic habitat modification.},

Plots included two segments of moderately-disturbed hill forest, a remnant patch of humid ravine forest surrounded by young coffee, a mature coffee plantation with remnant natural forest overstory, and a sub-mature teak monoculture. Species-number and diversity (H') were measured to be highest in the two hill forest plots. Equitability was highest in the Teak plot. Population numbers were highest in one of the forest plots and the Coffee plot. ‘Over-dominance’ by tramp species was exhibited in the Coffee plot, in which the three most common bird species (two bulbuls and a white-eye) comprised more than half of the individuals censused. All censuses were dominated by non-forest and forest-edge species; few raptors and species larger than 100 g were recorded in censuses. The patch of Ravine Forest was species-poor and yet supported several unusual species (e.g., Abbott's Babbler Malacocincla abbotti. Blue Chat Erithacus brunneus and Little Spiderhunter Arachnothera longirostris) found on no other plot. We suggest that: (1) the few remaining undisturbed tracts of moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forest should be declared natural reserves with complete protection from disturbance; (2) future forestry development in upland southeastern India should exclude teak monocultu re except on badly disturbed or clear-felled areas. Preferred development would feature coffee/ pepper plantation under maximum natural overstory, interspersed with remnant forest tracts for faunal and watershed protection. Such a combination would appear to have the least effect on the original forest avifauna.},

Principal components analysis of vegetation variables revealed clear differences between undisturbed and altered sites in woody plant and cane densities, canopy cover and vertical stratification. Bird species richness was lowest in cardamom plantations abandoned for 5 years and highest in logged and undisturbed forest. Bird species richness and similarity with undisturbed forest were significantly positively related to the vegetation component representing woody plant and cane (Calamus spp.) densities. Sites that were more similar in tree species composition had more similar bird communities whereas similarity in foliage profile between sites did not influence bird community similarity. Birds that were rare, were large-bodied and belonged to the carnivore, omnivore, bark-surface feeder and terrestrial insectivore guilds were adversely affected by habitat alteration. Restoring woody plant and cane densities and rainforest floristic composition in disturbed habitats may be required for management and conservation of bird communities typical to the region.},

We sampled the three taxa in the same plots within the same period of time. Two sites were selected in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in species richness with the decrease of shade cover, birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of biodiversity in coffee plantations, in particular, the importance of distinguishing between different levels of shade, and the possibility that different taxa might be responding to habitat changes at different spatial scales.},

Over the course of 3 years (1998–2000) the authors used line-transect identification surveys in the two regions, Mengsong and Jinuo, where four different habitats were surveyed: 6-year fallow fields; traditional economic forests; monsoon evergreen broadleaf forests; and montane rain forests. Data were analyzed for species diversity, richness (family, genera, species), co-occurrence (family, genera, species), characterization of migratory status and feeding habits. Both of these study areas are inhabited by minority groups (Hani and Jinuo) that employ swidden agriculture as their main form of economic activity. The forest landscape in the Jinuo ethnic region is quickly transforming due to changing agricultural practices, and as a result bird diversity and richness are declining, while the Hani ethnic region (Mengsong), with a stable form of traditional swidden agriculture, is maintaining a high diversity and richness of birds. The greatest differences in bird diversity between the two sites occurred in the traditional economic forests and the 6-year fallow fields where the Hani region had a much greater richness and diversity. The two natural forest types (monsoon evergreen broadleaf forests and montane rain forests) were more similar in richness and diversity and also maintained the greatest richness and diversity of the four forest types analyzed. The transformation of healthy forests into degraded landscapes is one of the major impacts of human activity on the natural environment, which is posing a great threat to biodiversity. This study looks at the bird diversity of the two regions and tries to take into account how humans can extract economic benefits while preserving ecological benefits, such as a landscape that allows biodiversity to thrive.},

Although species richness generally declined with increasing disturbance, no one group serves as a good indicator taxon9,10,11,12 for changes in the species richness of other groups. Species replacement from site to site (turnover) along the gradient also differs between taxonomic groups. The proportion of ‘morphospecies’ that cannot be assigned to named species and the number of ‘scientist-hours’ required to process samples both increase dramatically for smaller-bodied taxa. Data from these eight groups indicate the huge scale of the biological effort required to provide inventories of tropical diversity, and to measure the impacts of tropical forest modification and clearance.},

	abstract = {The effects of selective logging and other types of forest exploitation on bird communities are often studied latitudinally, i.e. a contemporaneous comparison of disturbed and pristine areas. Such an approach assumes that before disturbance those areas were equivalent. By comparing communities at a single site before and after disturbance, a so called longitudinal approach does not make that assumption but such studies can be resource intensive. In this study we adopt a latitudinal approach to explore the effects of disturbance on birds, but pay specific attention to whether natural geographically-based variation in the forest ecosystem may be a major contributory factor equal to, or greater than, effects of disturbance. Bird census data were collected from two Indonesian islands, Sumba and Buru. On Sumba the differences between habitat types in terms of species richness, species accumulation rates, and numbers of birds were swamped by simple site differences between the forest blocks sampled. On Buru, disturbed areas were more diverse than mature forest but it was still not possible to discount the effects of natural variation between forest areas. Although the islands support bird faunas which are rather similar in size and origin, local species diversities and abundances were significantly greater on Sumba. Substituting space for time is a common strategy in ecological research but the results of such studies should be viewed with caution.},

Recovery of rainforest bird community structure and composition, in relation to forest succession after slash-and-burn shifting cultivation or jhum, was studied in Mizoram, north-east India. Replicate fallow sites abandoned after shifting cultivation 1, 5, 10, 25 and ≈100 years ago, were compared with primary evergreen and semi-evergreen forest using transect and quadrat sampling. 2. Vegetation variables such as woody plant species richness, tree density and vertical stratification increased with fallow age in a rapid, non-linear, asymptotic manner. Principal components analysis of vegetation variables summarized 92·8\% of the variation into two axes: {PC}1 reflecting forest development and woody plant succession (variables such as tree density, woody plant species richness), and {PC}2 depicting bamboo density, which increased from 1 to 25 years and declined thereafter. 3. Bird species richness, abundance and diversity, increased rapidly and asymptotically during succession paralleling vegetation recovery as shown by positive correlations with fallow age and {PC}1 scores of sites. Bamboo density reflected by {PC}2 had a negative effect on bird species richness and abundance. 4. The bird community similarity (Morisita index) of sites with primary forest also increased asymptotically with fallow age indicating sequential species turnover during succession. Bird community similarity of sites with primary forest (or between sites) was positively correlated with both physiognomic and floristic similarities with primary forest (or between sites). 5. The number of bird species in guilds associated with forest development and woody plants (canopy insectivores, frugivores, bark feeders) was correlated with {PC}1 scores of the sites. Species in other guilds (e. g. granivores, understorey insectivores) appeared to dominate during early and mid-succession. 6. The non-linear relationships imply that fallow periods less than a threshold of 25 years for birds, and about 50–75 years for woody plants, are likely to cause substantial community alteration. 7. As 5–10-year rotation periods or jhum cycles prevail in many parts of north-east India, there is a need to protect and conserve tracts of late-successional and primary forest.},

Few species appeared to change foraging height, but netting rates suggest that the activity of some species had increased, or that some birds ranged over larger areas after logging. Although there is still much to be learned about the survival of birds in logged forest, large areas of this habitat are important for bird conservation. However, the susceptibility of logged forest to fire, and our present incomplete understanding of bird behaviour and population dynamics in logged forests mean that they should not be considered by conservationists as alternatives to reserves of primary forest.},

	abstract = {Abstract: I compared point count census data from both short and tall second-growth sites with counts taken from a nearby undisturbed tropical deciduous forest in coastal Jalisco, Mexico. Each of the second-growth sites differed significantly from the undisturbed forest in its bird composition Much of the change can be attributed to the improvement of conditions for some guild members (e.g., seedeaters) and the removal of adequate conditions for others (eg., trunk-foragers, Nit-eaten). Nonetheless, there was a significant difference in the effect on migrant us. Resident species that was independent of foraging guild; longdistance migratory species were significantly more likely to increase in abundance as a result of disturbance than were resident species Thus; many migratory species in western Mexico may benefit from the human-caused creation of midsuccessional habitats. It is important to note however, that this conclusion may not apply to more intensely disturbed habitats and does not apply to all migratory species In addition without information on the habitat and geographical distribution of migrants in winter, and habitat-dependent mortality rates, we cannot draw conclusions about the had-scale effects on the species that showed population changes in response to habitat disturbance.},

I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest ({UL}), two that were selectively logged at low ({LL}) and high ({HL}) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation ({PL}). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at {UL}. {LL} was similar to {UL} in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. {HL} had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected at {HL}. At {PL}, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result in significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park.},

Vegetation structure and composition was similar in logged and unlogged forest. The 66 most common species occurred with statistically similar frequency in logged and unlogged forest although 13 species were two times more frequent in intact forest. Numbers of total bird species were similar between logging gaps and the logged forest matrix, and between the logged forest matrix and unlogged forests. A comparison of numbers of species in 26 guilds based on migration strategy, diet, foraging substrate, and height strata also showed them to be similar regardless of logging history. Our results differed from previous studies that reported lower bird species richness and abundance of individual species in logged tropical forests than in unlogged forest. The differences might be explained by the lower logging intensity and/or greater levels of natural disturbance in our study area compared to previous studies.},

	abstract = {Both local and regional habitat characteristics influence species richness and community structure. The scale at which communities are studied, however, affects the detection of relationships between habitat characteristics and patterns of habitat selection, species diversity, and species composition, and may obscure observation of differences in how species perceive the scale of environmental variation. To determine how environmental variation at different scales is related to species occurrence and richness, I analyze mist net sampling data on several guilds of forest understory birds. Bird capture, vegetation, and physical environment data come from 23 0.5-ha study sites in primary and secondary forest in Amazonian Ecuador. The percentages of primary forest within concentric circles around each site form forest imbeddedness measures ({FIMs}), which are evaluated using satellite imagery. Variation in {FIM} size represents different measurement scales for determining forest cover. Primary forest cover is also analyzed in successively larger tori surrounding sites and is used, after variable reduction with Principal Components Analysis, to summarize variation in forest cover around sites. Linear regression, surface trend analysis, and ordination help to quantify how variation in guild composition and species richness is explained by forest cover, vegetation structure, and physical environment. Species composition is related to variation in primary forest cover, primarily within 200–600 m of study sites. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ({CCA}) indicates that nectarivores, shrub-layer frugivores, and ant-following birds are captured in areas with relatively low primary forest cover. In contrast, shrub-layer insectivores, shrub-layer omnivores, and birds probing dead foliage for large insects tend to be captured in areas of relatively high primary forest cover. The species richness of insect gleaners, ant followers, and omnivores is statistically related to the percent cover of primary forest within hundreds of meters from the study sites. This suggests that some mechanisms that influence guild composition act over substantial distances. Nonetheless, the small radii of {FIMs} related to the species richness of dead-leaf probers suggests that local conditions and variation in forest cover over short ({\textless}200 m) distances directly or indirectly influence species richness of some primary forest birds. The significant relationship between temperature variation among capture sites and species richness of ant-following birds suggests that these species choose among habitats in a temperature range at which physiological constraints operate, either directly on the birds themselves or on the ants they follow. Species richness within the nectarivores, in contrast, shows no relationship with large-scale variation in primary forest cover. The radius of the {FIM} most closely associated with species richness differs among guilds, which suggests variation in the scale at which forest cover is associated with guild structure, as well as variation in the strength of the association. Differences in the scale of relationships between environment and species richness among guilds suggest that the mechanisms that influence both species' habitat use and community structure differ among guilds. A single mechanism, operating at a single scale, is inconsistent with these patterns. Independent data from eight additional sites suggest that prediction of species richness from surrounding forest structure could be useful for managing human impacts on tropical avian communities.},

	abstract = {Complete surveys of the bird faunas of 4— to 10—acre study plots in six habitats were undertaken at a locality in the Apurimac Valley of Peru. Two of the habitats, forest and matorral, represent the primary vegetation of the region. Four secondary habitats incorporated varying degrees of departure from the structure and species composition of natural vegetation. Of the 211 species of land birds found in the 6 habitats, all but 10 were recorded in at least of the 2 primary habitats. With the exception of these 10 species the fauna of the secondary habitats was drawn from 3 species pools: forest, martorral and species common to both. The proportions of forest and matorral species in the secondary habitats varied greatly in relation of the vegetation of the habitats and their proximity to the source faunas. Mist nets were used in all the study plots to sample the using the airspace between 6 in. and 6 ft above the ground. The species diversity in samples of 100, calculated according to the Shannon—Wiener formula, showed rather little variation from one habitat to another. Of greater interest was the fact that in most nests caught fewer than half of the species known to be present. In temperature habitats virtually all species are eventually captured. This contrast is considered to reflect a fundamental difference in the spatial relationships of bird niches in temperate and tropical forests. The above and other evidence indicate that many tropical bird species confine their foraging activities to narrow vertical zones in the vegetational column. The number of bird species in the four secondary habitats was much lower than in primary habitats having similar foliage height profiles. The discrepancies are accounted for by an hypothesis that evokes two complementary parameters: the isolation of tracts of secondary habitat from primary vegetation and certain qualitative aspects of habitat that are not adequately expressed by the foilage height diversity index.},

A total of 12 3-day surveys were conducted at nine sites, divided among the four zones, which consisted of a coffee plantation on the edge of a large deforested area, and three primary forest zones at approximately 0, 1500, and 3200 m from the deforested area (0, 200, and 1000 m from small clearings; 200, 2000, and {\textgreater} 3500 m from roads). All sites were located on the same types of soil and terrain, and the vegetation of all forested sites was physiognomically similar. The most outstanding difference in bird species composition across zones was the reduced number of insectivores in areas of greater human impact (p=0·03). Interior forest insectivore species were significantly more likely to be absent from impacted forests (and non-forest habitats) than were non-insectivores (p=0·000004), and this tendency was also present in the results of other studies of tropical forest birds. These results underscore the need to take insectivores, as well as other particularly sensitive groups, into special consideration within conservation strategies if intact faunas are to be preserved.},

Results from a study in Guyinea-Bissau. Ostrich 70(2) 134–137 There is an increasing need for rapid habitat evaluations, in the tropics, for conservation purposes. Biodiversity is often assessed by studying relatively well known groups, such as birds. But even birds can be difficult to watch and identify in tropical habitats. Mist-netting is relatively free of observer bias, and allows sampling effort to be standardised. We sampled birds by mist-netting in seven wooded habitats, covering a wide range of levels of anthropogenic disturbance, in the Cufada region, Guinea Bissau. Capture rates, species diversity (as estimated by rarefaction) and originality of the bird communities appeared to be higher in disturbed habitats. Primary forest had the lowest capture rate and the lowest diversity index. Originality was also very low in primary forest. We discuss several possible causes for these patterns and argue that surveys based exclusively on mist-netting can be severely misleading, when comparing bird communities in different habitats.},

Higher numbers of frugivores, bark-gleaning insectivores, nectarivores and omnivores and fewer sallying insectivores and leaf-gleaning insectivores were found in logged forest. Supporting evidence that these differences could be attributed to logging was obtained from correlations of bird abundances with measures of forest structure or composition. Changes in forest structure are probably particularly important for sallying insectivores; these species will be one of the groups most at risk from logging and consequently will be useful indicators of logging impacts.},

The procedure was compared with the usual approach to the analysis of {BACIP} designs following the methods of Stewart-Oaten et al., which are based on classical Neymann-Pearson significance testing. Significance tests were performed at the 0.05 and 0.1 levels, power being calculated for a 25\% reduction in species capture rates. For the Bayesian analysis, we elicited one noninformative and three informative prior distributions representing polarized beliefs about the effect size of logging: a strong negative effect, little or no effect, and an effect related to the amount of canopy loss. Effect size was estimated by determining the extent to which there was agreement between the posteriors for eight propositions concerning effect size. These propositions ranged from a negative effect of {\textgreater}25\% reduction being very likely to a large positive effect of {\textgreater}25\% increase being very likely. Of 76 bird species recorded and nine species of mammals captured, there were sufficient data for analysis of 21 bird species, five ecological groups of birds, and five mammal species. The bulk of the classical tests were of low power; of the 99 species/microhabitat combinations tested, only 10 were significant at the 0.05 level (12 at the 0.1 level). The standard classical analysis allowed few conclusions other than the data were uninformative. The Bayesian procedure was more informative. For 68 species/microhabitat combinations, there was consensus among the posterior distributions for one or more of the propositions about effect size. The Bayesian analysis indicated that, over the entire study area, negative effects were not likely to be greater than the degree of canopy opening. However, in the microhabitats that received most of the damage, negative effects were likely for far more species.},

	abstract = {Bird species were surveyed in a variety of habitat types in a lightly populated area of western Brazilian Amazonia. Habitats surveyed were untagged forest, selectively logged forest, ‘capoeira’ (scrub regenerating on cleared land), cropfields, and an isolated 35 ha forest ‘island’. All habitats were within a few kilometres of each other. Many bird species were found to occur in all or most habitats, although the similarlity of the species assemblages dropped with increasing levels of disturbance of the natural vegetation. Certain understorey insectivores common in untagged forest were rarely observed in other habitats; disturbed areas contained higher numbers of flycalching insectivores or birds feeding on both insects and fruit, some of which were open-country rather than forest species. The avifauna of the forest ‘island’ was more similar to that of regenerating scrub than to that of tall forest, and the persistence of forest species was attributed to their ability to move to and from nearby continuous forest areas., Levantamentos da avifauna de uma variedade de tipos de habitats foram conduzidos numa área de baixa densidade populacional da Amazônia Brasilcira ocidental.

Fruit abundance varied seasonally in each habitat but was consistently greatest in the youngest site. Frugivores and nectarivores accounted for four (forest and older successional) or five (younger successional) of the five most frequently captured bird species in each habitat. Capture rates of arboreal frugivores and arboreal frugivore-insectivores were greatest in the youngest site and were not different between older habitats. Temporal variation in capture rates of frugivores resulted from habitat shifts by resident individuals and from arrival and departure of altitudinal and latitudinal migrants. Capture rates of frugivores correlated with fruit abundance in forest and the older successional habitat but not in the youngest site. Capture rates of nectarivores and insectivores varied over time and among habitats, but rates showed no correlation with capture rates of frugivores. The lack of positive correlations in seasonal capture rates among trophic groups and the correlation between frugivores and fruit abundance support the view that temporal and spatial variation in bird abundance in tropical bird communities is at least partially in response to variation in resource abundance.},

	abstract = {We carried out a one-year study of the avifauna along a regeneration gradient created by indigenous shifting cultivation in the Colombian Amazon rain forest. Regenerating one-hectare crop fields, from 1 to 17 years after abandonment, and undisturbed understory sites were compared in a sample effort of 4323 net hours. We made 878 captures of 103 species belonging to 11 trophic groups. Differences in species richness and number of individuals captured between regenerating areas and primary forest were low. A comparison of similarity indices among the sites for each habitat type showed no consistent differences, suggesting similar levels of local heterogeneity. Similarity indices calculated between sites of different-aged habitats, however, showed that young secondary growth at less than 10 years of abandonment was least similar to other sites, whereas old secondary growth between 13 to 17 years of abandonment, and forest understories, had the most similar avifauna. Two trophic groups were absent from the samples of the forest interior, and the abundance of the other nine varied among sites of regeneration. We conclude that slash and burn agriculture represents a high-intensity, small-magnitude disturbance to the forest avifauna. Large changes occur when the crop field is established and last until about 10 years after abandonment. Our data suggest that abandoned crop fields older than this age mimic the natural patch dynamics of the forest, making this type of agriculture an example of a potentially sustainable use of tropical forests, at least from the standpoint of its impact on bird communities.},

Birds were sampled using mist nets from 1992-93. Assemblages in each forest type were compared with reference plots in primary forest. While selective logging significantly affected understory bird assemblages, the effects were even greater when enrichment strips (linear plantations) were created following harvesting. Bird assemblages changed in proportion to the magnitude of the forestry disturbances. With increasing disturbance, nectarivores increased in abundance while the responses of frugivores were mixed. Insectivores dominated the understory avifauna and generally declined in abundance. The most diverse family of understory birds, the antbirds (Formicariidae), was typical of insectivores. Of the 22 species which occur in primary forest, a few (two spp.) became abundant following selective logging, but most (16 spp.) declined and several (four spp.) were not recorded in logged forest. Compositional changes and the frequency of extirpations were even greater following the creation of enrichment strips. Eliminating this silvicultural practice, or replacing it with a less damaging alternative, would better conserve the forest avifauna. Cutting vines, which did not greatly alter the structure of the forest understory, had little effect on understory birds.},

Results from my longer-term studies at Pasoh Forest Reserve (Negeri Sembilan, Peninsular Malaysia) established that flowers and fruits were consistently rare as food for birds. A comparison of two forest types at Pasoh revealed the effect of lower food availability on avian trophic organization. Food resources (e.g. flowers, fruits, arthropods) were less abundant in the regenerating than in the virgin forest, and bird species richness and individual abundance were also lower in the regenerating forest understory. However, the two forests did not differ significantly in the relative importance of the various foraging guilds, suggesting that similar types of resources were present in similar proportions. None of the birds sampled in the Malaysian rain-forest understory was a specialized consumer of understory flowers or fruit, whereas birds feeding mainly on foliage-dwelling arthropods were abundant and were represented by many species. This trophic organization is contrary to that reported for rain forests in other tropical regions but may simply reflect an allocation of harvestable productivity that is different rather than lower.},

	abstract = {I studied the relationship between diurnal raptor diversity, density, and richness, and landscape heterogeneity in continuous primary forests and forests farmed by native Amerindians in the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve of northeastern Honduras from January to June 1996 and 1997. I estimated landscape heterogeneity–the variability in naturally occurring and/or anthropogenic habitat mosaics–by mapping the extent and distribution of five human-modified and natural habitats in 24 1 km2 survey plots. I used the Shannon index to calculate landscape heterogeneity values for the respective plots based on the proportion of total area of each habitat within each plot. Diurnal raptor surveys from canopy-emergent viewpoints in these plots resulted in 137 observations of 18 species of raptors. Four species (Coragyps atratus, Ictinia plumbea, Leucopternis albicollis, and Buteo magnirostris) differed significantly in abundance among heterogeneity classes. Raptor diversity, density, and richness all increased directly with increasing landscape heterogeneity. Landscape heterogeneity was more important in explaining differences in raptor species diversity than the presence or extent of any single habitat or combination of habitats. In contrast to previous studies, my results indicate the importance of indigenous shifting cultivation in altering the naturally occurring patterns of habitat mosaics in lowland rain forest and its effect on bird species abundance and diversity in a rain forest ecosystem. {RESUMES} Estudié la relación entre la diversidad, densidad y la riqueza de especies de rapaces diurnas con la heterogeinidad de paisajes en bosques primaries contínues y bosques donde practican la agricultura migratoria indígenas de la Reserva de Biósfera del Río Plátano al noreste de Honduras entre los meses de enero a junio de 1996 y 1997. Evalué la heterogeneidad de paisajes-la variabilidad en mosaicos de hábitats naturales o antropogínicos-con mapas de cinco hábitats en 24 parcelas de 1 km2. Usé el Indice de Shannon para calcular valores de la heterogeneidad de cada parcela, basado en la proporción de cada hábitat. Desde el dosel, hice conteos de rapaces en las 24 parcelas que resukaron en 137 observaciones de 18 especies. Cuatro especies (Coragyps atratus, Ictinia plumbea, Leocopternis albicollis, y Buteo magnirostris) difirieron significativamente en abundancia entre los grupos de heterogeneidad del paisaje. La diversidad, densidad y riqueza de especies aumentaron conjuntamente con la heterogeneidad del paisaje. La heterogeneidad del paisaje rue mas importante para explicar la diversidad de rapaces que la presencia o el área de cualquier hábitat o combinación de hábitats. En contraste con estudios anteriores, mis resultados sugieron la importancia de la agricultura migratoria indigena en la alteracíon de mosaicos de hábitats naturales en los bosques hiimedos bajos, y su efecto en la abundancia y diversidad de aves de un ecosistema forestal.},

	abstract = {The global pledge to deliver ‘a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010’ is echoed in a number of regional and national level targets. There is broad consensus, however, that in the absence of conservation action, biodiversity will continue to be lost at a rate unprecedented in the recent era. Remarkably, we lack a basic system to measure progress towards these targets and, in particular, we lack standard measures of biodiversity and procedures to construct and assess summary statistics. Here, we develop a simple classification of biodiversity indicators to assist their development and clarify purpose. We use European birds, as example taxa, to show how robust indicators can be constructed and how they can be interpreted. We have developed statistical methods to calculate supranational, multi-species indices using population data from national annual breeding bird surveys in Europe. Skilled volunteers using standardized field methods undertake data collection where methods and survey designs differ slightly across countries. Survey plots tend to be widely distributed at a national level, covering many bird species and habitats with reasonable representation. National species' indices are calculated using log-linear regression, which allows for plot turnover. Supranational species' indices are constructed by combining the national species' indices weighted by national population sizes of each species. Supranational, multi-species indicators are calculated by averaging the resulting indices. We show that common farmland birds in Europe have declined steeply over the last two decades, whereas woodland birds have not. Evidence elsewhere shows that the main driver of farmland bird declines is increased agricultural intensification. We argue that the farmland bird indicator is a useful surrogate for trends in other elements of biodiversity in this habitat.},

	abstract = {We explore population trends of widespread and common woodland birds using data from an extensive European network of ornithologists for the period 1980–2003. We show considerable differences exist in the European trends of species according to the broad habitat they occupy and the degree to which they specialize in habitat use. On average, common forest birds are in shallow decline at a European scale; common forest birds declined by 13\%, and common forest specialists by 18\%, from 1980 to 2003. In comparison, populations of common specialists of farmland have declined moderately, falling on average by 28\% from 1980 to 2003. These patterns contrast with that shown by generalist species whose populations have been roughly stable over the same period, their overall index increasing by 3\%. There was some evidence of regional variation in the population trends of these common forest species. The most obvious pattern was the greater stability of population trends in Eastern Europe compared with other regions considered. Among common forest birds, long-distance migrants and residents have on average declined most strongly, whereas short-distance migrants have been largely stable, or have increased. There was some evidence to suggest that ground- or low-nesting species have declined more strongly on average, as have forest birds with invertebrate diets. Formal analysis of the species trends confirmed the influence of habitat use, habitat specialization and nest-site; the effects of region and migration strategy were less clear-cut. There was also evidence to show that year-to-year variation in individual species trends at a European scale was influenced by cold winter weather in a small number of species. We recommend that the species trend information provided by the new pan-European scheme should be used alongside existing mechanisms to review the conservation status of European birds. The analysis also allows us to reappraise the role of common forest bird populations as a potential barometer of wider forest health. The new indicator appears to be a useful indicator of the state of widespread European forest birds and might prove to be a useful surrogate for trends in forest biodiversity and forest health, but more work is likely to be needed to understand the interaction between bird populations and their drivers in forest.},

	abstract = {World leaders have set global and regional targets to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, and their relative success, or failure, in meeting these aims will be measured against a set of indicators. For such indicators to be effective, they need to meet a range of practical and scientific criteria. Their development is often driven pragmatically by the information available. One such biodiversity indicator that has proven highly effective and influential in Europe is the wild bird indicator. This is based on the composite population trends of birds combined using a geometric mean and derived from national breeding bird surveys. Recent work has emphasized the importance of common species to ecosystem functioning and suggested that the depletion of their populations might significantly affect ecosystem services. National governments and the European Union are increasingly using these measures to assess sustainable development strategies, environmental and ecosystem health, as well as in the fulfillment of biodiversity targets. Equivalent indicators have been published in North America. There are a number of reasons to believe that birds might be useful indicators of biodiversity. They are sensitive to anthropogenic changes, they are well known, excellent time-series exist, and they have a resonance and connection with people and their lives. Yet, there are counter arguments and some risks in using birds in this way. Our work provides a blueprint for others to follow using similar data on birds or other taxa, and in other countries and regions. In the discussion, we review the strengths and weaknesses of using bird population trends as biodiversity indicators, and look forward to how this work might be developed. Wild bird indicators only measure a component of biodiversity change and need to be used carefully to assist policy makers and land managers in managing the natural resources and conserving nature.},

	abstract = {Global changes are modifying the structure of species assemblages, but the generality of resulting diversity patterns and of their drivers is poorly understood. Any such changes can be detected and explained by comparing temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity over broad spatial extents. In this study, we addressed three complementary questions: How did bird taxonomic and functional diversity change over the past 40 years in the conterminous United States? Are these trends non-linear? Can temporal variations in functional diversity be explained by broad-scale changes in climate and vegetation productivity? We quantified changes in taxonomic and functional diversity for 807 bird assemblages over the past four decades (1970–2011) considering a suite of 16 ecological traits for 435 species. We found increases in local bird species richness and taxonomic equitability that plateaued in the early 2000’s while total abundance declined over the whole period. Functional richness, the total range of traits in an assemblage, increased due to the rising prevalence of species with atypical life-history strategies and under-represented habitat or trophic preferences. However, these species did not trigger major changes in the functional composition of bird assemblages. Inter-annual variations in climate and primary productivity explained the richness of bird life-history traits in local assemblages, suggesting that these traits are influenced by broad-scale environmental factors, while others respond more to more local drivers. Our results highlight that a comparative analysis of the multiple facets of functional diversity can raise novel insights on processes underlying temporal trends in biodiversity.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that an increase in the area of low-intensity land-use on arable land (e.g. set-aside fields and short-rotation coppice), and high or increased farmland habitat heterogeneity, may halt or reverse the observed population decline of farmland birds. We tested these hypotheses by undertaking farmland bird censuses during two contrasting periods of agricultural policies and land-use (i.e. 1994 and 2004) in a farmland region covering a gradient of forest- to farmland-dominated landscapes in Sweden. Local species richness (i.e. at 3hectare sites) declined significantly between 1994 and 2004. Local species richness was positively related to habitat heterogeneity in both years of study whereas temporal change in species richness was not. Local change in species richness was positively associated with a change in the proportion of non-rotational set aside and short-rotation coppice (i.e. low-intensity land-use forms), but also to changes in the amount of spring-sown crops. However, the effect of low-intensity land-use was significantly dependent on the amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. An increase in low-intensity land-use was linked to an increase (or less marked decrease) in species richness at sites located in open farmland surroundings but to a decrease in richness at sites located in forest surroundings. This interaction between amount of forest and low-intensity land-use could be interpreted as a “rare habitat effect”, where an increase in a farmland habitat only positively affects biodiversity when it was originally uncommon (i.e. open farmland areas). Our results suggest that conservation measures of farmland biodiversity have to be put in a landscape context.},

	abstract = {Changes in forestry practices and on-going climate change may both have large impacts on forest bird populations. However, large-scale analyses of the effects of temporal changes in forest structure on forest bird numbers are largely lacking. We compared temporal trends from two Swedish nationwide long-term monitoring schemes, the Swedish Bird Survey (1998–2015) and the Swedish National Forestry Inventory (1983–2014), giving representative values for both forest and bird changes over an area of 35millionha. Since 1998 the total area of middle-aged and mature forest increased by 6.4\%. In parallel, several forest structures potentially beneficial to birds (dead wood, retention trees on clear cuts, multi-layer forests, old forest and broadleaved forest) increased somewhat in abundance, most likely as a result of legislation changes and increasing areas under forest certification schemes. Summer temperatures also increased, with warm summers dominating since 2002. In 1998–2015, the population sizes of 58 forest bird species on average increased, as did the number of species observed per route, with no general difference between forest specialists (16 species) and generalists (42 species). However, from around 2005, the positive trends in bird numbers and many forest structures have levelled out. An analysis of species population trends in relation to a measure of climate sensitivity (Species Temperature Index, {STI}) suggested that forest birds, just like Swedish birds in general, have indeed been affected by a warming climate. But given their {STI}, forest birds on average had more positive trends than non-forest birds, suggesting that other factors than climate have affected them positively. Strong candidate factors are the documented changes in forest quality and quantity. Whereas our data and analyses are correlational, and no firm conclusions on causality therefore can be drawn, it is reasonable to assume that the recent increases in forest quantity, forest quality, and summer temperatures, all have contributed to the general increase in forest bird numbers in Sweden. But the relative contribution of these driving forces remains to be determined. When it comes to the potentially positive effects of improving forest quality in terms of increases in old forest, stratification, retention trees and dead wood, it is noteworthy that many of the positive trends in forest structures since the mid-1990s seem to have ceased recently.},

	abstract = {A key aspect of monitoring regional changes in biodiversity is to quantify the temporal turnover in communities. Turnover has traditionally been assessed by observing range change. However, we are often interested in trends in biodiversity of large regions as opposed to single sites, as with Convention for Biological Diversity targets. Extinctions and colonizations tend to be rare events at the regional level; changes in species proportions estimated from spatio-temporal models of species abundance are then more sensitive measures of community change. We investigated three measures for quantifying turnover based on species proportions, and estimated how each varies across Great Britain using data from the British Trust for Ornithology's Breeding Bird Survey. All three measures identify high turnover associated with loss of biodiversity in the south-east of England. This seems to be driven by changes in the farmland bird community, and by turnover in the scarcer species of the woodland bird community. The measures also show evidence of high turnover in the west of Scotland; these changes may be linked to climate change, although precision in our measures for this region is relatively poor due to low survey effort. Policy implications. Turnover in ecological communities may be quantified by modelling species abundance, and measuring how resulting species proportions change over time. When used alongside estimated temporal trends in biodiversity, these can identify areas and communities showing greatest evidence for change. How, and indeed even whether, society should respond to such changes depends on further investigation into the causes of the changes, and the extent to which these are seen as undesirable and avoidable. For those communities with adequate survey data, we recommend that these methods augment the suite of measures used for routine assessment of change, hence acting as a more sensitive trigger to set in motion exploration of causes and consideration of adaptive actions to be taken by land managers and policymakers.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss in farmlands is widely documented, and agriculture intensification has been identified as a main driver of this decline. Numerous agri-environmental policies have been implemented to assess the negative impacts of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. However, most published studies focus on land-use scenarios, thus neglecting the economic dimension. We develop a bio-economic spatially explicit modelling across 620 small French agricultural areas, which couples a public decision maker under budgetary constraint, regional economic agents in a context of uncertainty and breeding bird dynamics. Using dynamic models, we analyse the direct impacts of several current economic scenarios of the Common Agriculture Policy on common bird communities through five ecological indicators, all related to breeding populations of birds in farmlands: the farmland bird index ({FBI}), a generalist bird index ({GBI}), the Shannon diversity index, a community specialization index ({CSI}) and a community trophic index ({CTI}). We consider these indicators to scan various functional traits of bird communities. Trends in the different indicators are significantly contrasted pending on economic policy scenarios. Scenarios promoting intensive crops lead to small but specialized communities with more granivorous species, hence a low trophic level for the community. By contrast, promoting extensive grasslands increases the population size, enhances high trophic level but decreases community specialization. Evaluation of agricultural policies should not rely on a single indicator per taxonomic group. In the context of potential reversal of current bird declines, bio-economic modelling, involving farmland incomes, is proposed as a relevant support for decision making about sustainable agri-environmental policies. Promoting extensive grasslands is essential for the sustainable management of bird communities and agriculture. We, however, reveal more complex economic effects and synergies between public incentives, which appear to give interesting leverage for enhancing the bio-economic effectiveness of agricultural policies.},

	abstract = {1. Farmland biodiversity continues to decline mainly because of agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Agri-environment schemes can be designed to halt this loss by favouring extensification of agricultural practices and through sympathetic management of field boundaries and fallow land. In Europe, High Nature Value ({HNV}) farmland is defined as low-intensity farmland supporting or associated with a high rate of biodiversity, in terms of species richness or habitat diversity and therefore plays a crucial role in the maintenance of European biodiversity. However, no large-scale analysis has explored the role of these areas in achieving conservation goals. 2. We analysed information from widely used indicators in order to describe the impact of low-intensity agriculture on farmland biodiversity in France. We used the {HNV} farmland indicator, based on agricultural statistics such as the Farm Structure Survey and the grassland survey, and common bird indicators, i.e. the Farmland Bird Indicator ({FBI}), the Community Specialization Index ({CSI}) and species richness indexes, based on the French Breeding Bird Survey. 3. Temporal trends in the farmland bird indicator showed that populations of farmland birds were more likely to increase inside {HNV} areas compared to non-{HNV} areas. Although species richness is not higher within {HNV} farmland, bird communities are composed by more specialist species than in non-{HNV} areas. In addition, these specialist bird species are significantly more abundant in {HNV} areas. 4. Synthesis and applications. Further farmland biodiversity decline is potentially reversible through an appropriate management of {HNV} areas. Existing and future agri-environment schemes should focus on preserving and extending {HNV} farmland, by favouring the maintenance of low-intensity agriculture and landscape complexity. Priority should be given to preserving diversity at the community level, with the help of adequate indicators, such as the ones presented here. The role of {HNV} farmland or similar concepts in combining agriculture and biodiversity goals should be further analysed and further used as large-scale conservation tools.},

Here we compare tree and bird biodiversity in actively cultivated and abandoned cacao agroforests, and use a space for time approach to ask how this diversity has changed over 100 years of succession. Tree and bird communities were surveyed in cacao agroforests, secondary forests at different stages of succession and primary forests in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies, to test the prediction that there are consistent temporal trends in alpha and beta-diversity across taxa. Temporal alpha-diversity was taxon dependent. We found that tree alpha-diversity increased with forest age. In contrast, there was no temporal trend in bird alpha-diversity. Tree and bird species richness were negatively correlated. Tree and bird composition varied with forest age and environmental distance. A greater proportion of native trees, and of highly forest-dependent and insectivorous birds were found in older forests. Our analyses show that actively cultivated and young abandoned cacao agroforests can sustain high bird alpha-diversity, despite lower levels of tree alpha-diversity. Old secondary and primary forests have unique species compositions including more sensitive and specialist species. Compositional shifts with successional stage for both trees and birds produce a patchwork of habitats that contribute to regional gamma-diversity. Synthesis and applications. Our research highlights the value of actively cultivated cacao agroforests and secondary forest alongside primary forests as reservoirs of biodiversity. By supporting both biodiversity and livelihoods, traditionally grown shade-cacao agroforests fall within a people and nature framework. Taken together, these results emphasise the contributions of secondary forests, which are often overlooked, to conservation.},

However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. Land use/land cover ({LULC}) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4\% and 87.3\% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance ({MSA}) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100\% to 76.8\% to 52.2\% to 24.5\% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration.},

	abstract = {The challenge of searching for patterns of species turnover dynamics in communities of living organisms is directly related to solving problems of stability and functioning of ecosystems. Avian communities are an essential structural and functional component of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems which are highly diverse and play an important role in a wide range of ecosystem functions. The issue of changes in the dynamics of amphibiotic landscape complexes, where terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems conjugate, is practically not solved. In this connection, a study was carried out within a landscape system, which presents terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that were in different degrees of anthropogenic transformation. The dynamics of bird communities was considered in the context of recent global climate change. The investigation was conducted in the landscapes of the south and south-east of Ukraine in the nesting seasons 1988–2018. Within the landscape system associated with the Molochny estuary, the ten most important types of ecosystems were distinguished, which included : agricultural lands, artificial forest belts, meadows, islands and spits, reed beds, urban areas, solonchaks, steppe, cliffs, artificial forests. The temporal turnover of the bird communities was decomposed into two parts: the first term (D1) related to the amount of change in community composition, and the second term (D2) being dependent only on the amount of change in community size sensu its abundance. The contribution ratio of the species and of the environment variable were calculated to identify drivers that influence the turnover measure. The average annual temperature and the sum of annual temperatures were considered as environment variables. The bird metacommunity of the studied landscape system was represented by 132 species from 86 genera, 42 families and 13 orders. During the research period the average annual temperature varied from 9.5 to 12.5 ˚C. and the temperature dynamics were subject to the linear trend. An oscillatory component was also present in the temperature dynamics. The annual rainfall ranged 220–761 mm. A coherent change in precipitation and temperature was observed in the period until 2011. After that, the temperature growth stabilized and the amount of precipitation began to fall sharply. The steppe bird community was represented by an extremely small number of species, but demonstrated the ability to maintain a stable structure for a long time. The main fluctuations of the community were quantitative changes in abundance, while the turnover of species was practically absent. Species of the community replace each other cyclically, but there were no targeted changes in community structure. Temperature and precipitation were the main drivers of the bird community in the steppe. The bird communities on salt marshes were characterized by a stable abundance, but a constant directed turnover of species. Reduced water levels and the disappearance of islands in the salt marshes increased the risk of threats from predators, which could lead to a decrease in the abundance of some species. The islands and spits were characterized by high species turnover with quasi-cyclical population dynamics. The main feature of the community dynamics was a decrease in the role of precipitation and an increase in the role of the time factor. The role of temperature remained stably low. The species richness of bird communities in agrarian lands was higher than in steppe communities. The turnover measure was significant because of the increased abundance of Alauda arvensis. Over time, the role of precipitation in the community dynamics has been decreasing and the role of time has been increasing. The value of temperature varied, but was at a stationary level. The turnover of species was compensated by an increase in the abundance of bird communities. The obtained results are in line with findings indicating that despite more stable land use intensities in recent years, climate change has not overtaken land use intensities as the main driver of bird population dynamics.},

However, there is little understanding of how shifts affect community composition and we lack empirical evidence of recent impacts of climate change on the diversity of vertebrates. Using a long-term comprehensive dataset on bird abundance, we explore recent patterns of change in different components of species diversity and avian communities, and postulate a process to explain the observed changes in diversity and specialization. Location Britain. Methods We used Breeding Bird Survey data for Britain from 1994 to 2006 to calculate site-specific diversity and community specialization indices. We modelled these indices using generalized additive models to examine the relationship between local climate and spatial and temporal trends in community metrics and the relationship between changes in diversity and specialization. Results Local temperature was positively associated with alpha diversity, which increased over the study period, supporting empirical and theoretical predictions of the effect of climate warming. Diversity increased in all habitats, but the rate of increase was greatest in upland areas. However, temperature was negatively associated with community specialization indices, which declined over the same period. Our modelling revealed a nonlinear relationship between community specialization and species diversity. Main conclusions Our models of diversity and specialization provide stark empirical evidence for a link between warming climate and community homogenization. Over a 13-year period of warming temperatures, diversity indices increased while average community specialization decreased. We suggest that the observed diversity increases were most likely driven by range expansion of generalist species and that future warming is likely to increase homogenization of community structure. When assessed in combination, diversity and specialization measures provide a powerful index for monitoring the impacts of climate change.},

Subject to validation, such indices could inform sensitively about ecosystem health (defined as proximity to a stable or desired state) and the natural capital status or potential ecosystem service delivery. The available approaches for monitoring biological assemblages and the data to which they might be applied are reviewed, including consideration of sources of error. A particularly promising method is the calculation of ‘diversity profiles’ (Leinster \& Cobbold, 2012), which present a ‘signature’ describing the range of biological variation, considering both species’ identities and their relative abundances. The diversity profile approach was tested using a long-term bird monitoring data set for woodland birds in the {UK}, applying species similarities based on phylogeny, habitat selection and ecological function (i.e. diet). Tests were conducted using three nested sets of species with different levels of specialization with respect to woodland. The influence of quantifiable sources of error was evaluated using bootstrapping. Profile shape and temporal changes in diversity varied in magnitude and pattern with the choice of similarity measure and species set, with the pattern of temporal change in diversity showing either an increase or a decline, depending on the choice of analysis. This shows that the profile approach has the potential to reveal subtle variations in assemblage structure, although careful application and interpretation of outputs are required. The bootstrapping results revealed that uncertainty in profile values was high, but that this was due chiefly to uncertainty in interspecific similarities, as opposed to sampled abundance values, but this relates to the specific application to the datasets tested, rather than to the method in general. Different approaches to quantifying differences between species (phylogenetic, habitat preference and dietary) revealed different aspects of assemblage variability. Combined with the calculation of reference levels of diversity for known assemblages or sets of conditions such that observed variation can be interpreted quantitatively, assemblage monitoring via diversity profiles could add valuable, quantitative inference to ongoing monitoring, and hence the assessment of ecosystem health, potentially bridging the gap between conservation and a purely economic valuation of the status of natural capital.},

Location Ouessant Island, France, Great Britain. Methods We assessed the temporal trend of the relative proportion of generalist species breeding on Ouessant island and whether high-temperature tolerant species have replaced less tolerant species over this time period. We further tested the relationship between the observed change in the avifauna composition, and long-term population species’ trends measured independently in potential source regions of colonist species (France and Great Britain). Results During the whole study period, Ouessant island has experienced a strong increase in species richness (+41\%), but a severe decline in specialist species. In contrast, we found no change in species composition in terms of their temperature-tolerance. The observed trend was highly correlated with species trends measured in the Great Britain. Main conclusions Our results revealed an ongoing biotic homogenization process towards more generalist species, coupled with a strong local increase in species richness. The observed trend was most likely driven by a strong habitat change in the island occurring during the period considered, favouring the colonization of generalist species. Our results show that an increase in species richness can be misinterpreted as a sign of conservation improvement and that assessing change in community composition using species-specific ecological traits provides more accurate insights for conservation planning purposes.},

To assess the potential effects of chlorpyrifos on the bird community, a multiyear, multisite monitoring program was carried out in treated cider orchards (in the United Kingdom) and treated citrus orchards (in Spain). Constant-effort mist netting was used over several consecutive years in the United Kingdom (2012–2014) and Spain (2010–2012). The general structure of the bird community and the presence of breeding species were analyzed. Twelve and 11 bird species (out of 81 and 45 trapped) in Spain and the United Kingdom, respectively, exceeded the 2\% dominance value. For a selection of 6 species in citrus and 4 in cider orchards, N-mixture models were fitted to the number of trapped birds. The abundance of most species was strongly and significantly affected by seasonality. No species showed any indication of reduction in population size over the years. The results of this extensive field program support the indications that chlorpyrifos spray applications present a low risk to the bird community over the years.

Location Swaziland, southern Africa. Methods Generalized estimated equations were used to estimate changes in bird species occurrence between 1998 and 2008. Remote sensing of aerial photographs/satellite images was used to assess vegetation changes during the same period. We assessed the role of shrub encroachment for bird communities by testing the relationship between change in species occurrence and species habitat using a general linear model. We also estimated species richness, colonization and extinction and used general linear models to test the effects of vegetation changes on these parameters. Results More than half of the bird species showed a significant change in occurrence between 1998 and 2008: 32 species increased and 29 decreased. Change in species occurrence was significantly explained by species habitat. Species significantly increasing were mainly associated with wooded savanna, whereas species significantly decreasing were mainly associated with open savanna. Species richness decreased significantly, and this decrease was significantly explained by shrub cover increase at the plot scale (from 24\% to 44\% on average). Extinction at the plot scale was significantly influenced by the loss of grass cover, while colonization at the plot scale was influenced by tree cover increase. Main conclusions This study represents the first evidence of temporal changes in bird communities owing to shrub encroachment in southern Africa. Despite its short time frame (10 years), this study shows dramatic changes in both vegetation structure and bird community composition. This confirms the general concern for southern African bird species associated with open savanna if current trends continue.},

Mountains are especially susceptible to such changes (e.g., climate change) and, consequently, have been identified as ecosystems of conservation concern. With their sharp physical and ecological transitions, altitudinal gradients allow examining the influence of different climatic conditions and land use types on species assemblages across small spatial extents, and thus, they constitute natural laboratories to study diversity–environment relationships. Location Switzerland. Methods We take advantage of long-term (20 years) monitoring data and an extensive trait dataset (100 traits) to examine spatial patterns, temporal trends, and spatio-temporal dynamics in functional and beta diversity of bird communities in the Swiss Alps. Results Functional diversity indices showed a congruent pattern over time and across space; most indices decreased over the study period and were strongly correlated with altitude. In agreement with studies from the tropics, we found that communities in the lowlands were functionally over-dispersed, whereas communities at higher elevations were functionally clustered. High-altitude communities exhibited high functional originality, low levels of niche differentiation and a high turnover rate. Beta diversity declined over the study period. Conclusions Our findings suggest that pastoral abandonment does not result in an increase in avian functional diversity as most species colonizing woody-encroached grasslands are functionally redundant, whereas alpine meadows are inhabited by species exhibiting a high degree of habitat specialization and unique functional traits. Hence, the tree line constitutes a boundary between two well-differentiated functional groups: one representing a functional continuum from lowlands dominated by agricultural landscape to high-mountain forests, and the other one composed of alpine communities. Overall, this study reveals a process of biotic homogenization (i.e., increasing functional similarity) across the last two decades in the Swiss Alps, coinciding with the recently reported increases in the abundance of generalist species.},

The Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2010 Biodiversity Target, and the associated indicator for {IAS}, has stimulated globally coordinated efforts to quantify patterns in the extent of biological invasion, its impact on biodiversity and policy responses. Here, we report on the outcome of indicators of alien invasion at a global scale. Location Global. Methods We developed four indicators in a pressure-state-response framework, i.e. number of documented {IAS} (pressure), trends in the impact of {IAS} on biodiversity (state) and trends in international agreements and national policy adoption relevant to reducing {IAS} threats to biodiversity (response). These measures were considered best suited to providing globally representative, standardized and sustainable indicators by 2010. Results We show that the number of documented {IAS} is a significant underestimate, because its value is negatively affected by country development status and positively by research effort and information availability. The Red List Index demonstrates that {IAS} pressure is driving declines in species diversity, with the overall impact apparently increasing. The policy response trend has nonetheless been positive for the last several decades, although only half of countries that are signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity ({CBD}) have {IAS}-relevant national legislation. Although {IAS} pressure has apparently driven the policy response, this has clearly not been sufficient and/or adequately implemented to reduce biodiversity impact. Main conclusions For this indicator of threat to biodiversity, the 2010 Biodiversity Target has thus not been achieved. The results nonetheless provide clear direction for bridging the current divide between information available on {IAS} and that needed for policy and management for the prevention and control of {IAS}. It further highlights the need for measures to ensure that policy is effectively implemented, such that it translates into reduced {IAS} pressure and impact on biodiversity beyond 2010.},

Model-based scenarios linking climate, land use and biodiversity can be exceptionally useful tools for decision support in this context. We present a modeling framework that links climate projections, private land use decisions including farming, forest and urban uses and the abundances of common birds as an indicator of biodiversity. Our major innovation is to simultaneously integrate the direct impacts of climate change and land use on biodiversity as well as indirect impacts mediated by climate change effects on land use, all at very fine spatial resolution. In addition, our framework can be used to evaluate incentive-based conservation policies in terms of land use and biodiversity over several decades. The results for our case study in France indicate that the projected effects of climate change dominate the effects of land use on bird abundances. As a conservation policy, implementing a spatially uniform payment for pastures has a positive effect in relatively few locations and only on the least vulnerable bird species.},

The principal current threats at sea are posed by commercial fisheries (through competition and mortality on fishing gear) and pollution, whereas on land, alien invasive predators, habitat degradation and human disturbance are the main threats. Direct exploitation remains a problem for some species both at sea and ashore. The priority actions needed involve: a) formal and effective site protection, especially for Important Bird Area ({IBA}) breeding sites and for marine {IBA} feeding and aggregation sites, as part of national, regional and global networks of Marine Protected Areas; b) removal of invasive, especially predatory, alien species (a list of priority sites is provided), as part of habitat and species recovery initiatives; and c) reduction of bycatch to negligible levels, as part of comprehensive implementation of ecosystem approaches to fisheries. The main knowledge gaps and research priorities relate to the three topics above but new work is needed on impacts of aquaculture, energy generation operations and climate change (especially effects on the distribution of prey species and rise in sea level).

	abstract = {Riparian zones in the semi-arid West are disproportionately important habitats for both breeding birds and agricultural operations. Despite growing interest in studying avian–habitat relationships to inform land management decisions, few studies have described temporal changes in riparian bird communities. We compared indices of avian abundance and diversity from 3 streamside vegetation associations in east-central Oregon during May–June 2014 with indices from 1993–1994. Our objectives were to identify patterns of change in the avian community with a focus on riparian shrub-dependent species, re-examine previously reported relationships between avian abundance and vegetation volume, and identify possible causes of declines in bird abundance and diversity. We combined historical field protocols to survey birds and measure riparian vegetation with modern analytical techniques. We found few differences in species richness between study periods but documented approximately 30\% species turnover. Increases in diversity were driven by increased detections of grassland and wetland bird species and increased evenness due to precipitous declines in detections for 2 of 3 riparian shrub–dependent focal species (i.e., Yellow Warbler [Setophaga petechia] and Willow Flycatcher [Empidonax traillii]). Detections of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), our third focal species, declined by a smaller margin. Large changes in detections of riparian shrub–dependent species did not reflect trends in mesic shrub cover or volume, which had been identified as likely drivers of obligate species abundance. Focal species' declines reflected regional Breeding Bird Survey trends, corroborating our finding that their declines were not a result of changes in local site conditions. Our findings suggest that managing lands to increase wetness and extent of riparian zones can be beneficial for grassland and wetland bird species. However, managing for riparian shrub cover or volume, important metrics of grazing intensity and riparian system health, may be insufficient to conserve riparian shrub–dependent birds because other unidentified local and/or regional factors are likely contributing to habitat suitability of riparian shrub–dependent birds.},

However, studies aimed at assessing their effectiveness, focusing on several species simultaneously are scarce. We assessed the effectiveness of the system of protected areas ({PAs}) of Lombardy, Northern Italy, in conserving bird populations by comparing the changes from 1992 to 2013 in the occurrence of 54 breeding bird species censused in areas classified in different protection categories, namely Nature Reserves ({NRs}), areas designed predominantly for the protection of nature; Regional Parks ({RPs}), naturally valuable areas where human activities, including intensive agriculture, are allowed; and non-protected areas ({NPAs}). Overall, occurrence of common birds increased in Lombardy in the last 20 years and farmland and long-distance migrants ({LDMs}), which suffered sharp declines at a continental scale, showed stable and increasing trends, respectively. These trends were, however, the balance between those of species whose occurrence markedly increased, and those of species that dramatically declined. Species occurred more often in {PAs} than in {NPAs}, while temporal trends in occurrence were significantly more positive in {RPs} than in both {NRs} and {NPAs}. Hence, {PAs} seemed effective in preserving common bird communities. Occurrence of woodland and short-distance migrant species was higher in {PAs} than in {NPAs}, while occurrence of farmland species and {LDMs} was similar in all protection categories. {PAs} of Lombardy appear therefore effective only in protecting some categories of birds. Farmland and {LDM} birds would benefit more from ecologically sustainable land-use policies aiming at improving agro-ecosystem biodiversity than from protected areas.},

	abstract = {There are several applications for which one might monitor avian communities but one of the main ones is to evaluate the impact of an anthropogenic disturbance (e.g. logging). There has been relatively little attention paid to how sensitive such monitoring might be to sampling strategy, which refers to the temporal frequency and spatial extent over which the monitoring is conducted rather than the actual method by which the data are collected (i.e. strip transect, point counts, etc.). By using data collected during 92 visits spaced over three successive years at one site, 48 different sampling strategies (‘schedules’) are emulated by using resampling techniques to investigate the sensitivity of outcomes to transect size (3 classes, ≈17, ≈34, ≈50 ha) and sampling intensity (once-off; one or more times per season; one, two or three years). Sensitivity is gauged by reference to the accuracy of estimates of species richness and the maximum total density. A key point is that the analyses are to be based only on species recorded in the pre-impact phases of the monitoring; thus, losses of species or individuals of these species cannot be offset or obscured by increases in disturbance-tolerant or exotic species when judging whether there has been a deleterious impact. For the kind of forest and avian community considered here, single-visit surveys performed uniformly badly on every criterion, while results for the smallest spatial extents (≈17 ha) deviated greatly from outcomes for larger transects. A recommended sampling schedule derived from these analyses is two visits every season for two successive years at the largest spatial extent (i.e. eight visits at ≈50 ha). This would form the basis by which to assess ‘significant’ declines in richness or maximum total density, with the entire survey repeated prior to and following the putative impact. These assessments require the calculation of the magnitudes of declines that might arise by chance from sampling the unperturbed community and corresponding power estimates for specified changes.},

	abstract = {The tropical Andes rank first among the world's 25 “hotspots” of biodiversity and endemism yet are threatened and little studied. We contrast population trends in avian diversity in montane cloud forest (bosque altoandino) and similar forest degraded by the planting of introduced tree species (bosque introducido) in the Mazán Reserve, Ecuador. We describe changes in bird diversity and abundance in these habitats over 12 years and evaluate the nature of change within these avian communities. On the basis of 2976 count detections and 419 net captures of 76 species of landbirds, indices of similarity between the habitats were low, with only 47.6\% of species occurring in both forest types. From 1994–95 to 2006–07, species richness decreased from 54 to 31 in bosque introducido and from 67 to 30 in bosque altoandino. Capture rates also declined from 56.0 to 28.5 birds per 100 mist-net hr in bosque introducido and from 38.0 to 22.4 birds per 100 mist-net hr in bosque altoandino. We explore various potentially interacting factors that might have caused the observed changes in bird communities, including changes in vegetation within the Mazán Reserve and environmental changes resulting from global warming. But our results also suggest that local and regional changes in habitat outside of the Mazán Reserve were likely responsible for some community changes within the reserve. We argue for increased population monitoring to verify trends and to strengthen the effectiveness of conservation efforts in the Andes.},

	abstract = {The aim of the paper is to examine the temporal and spatial changes observed over a 25-year period in the waterbird community nesting in the largest coastal lagoon around the Mediterranean; to examine driving factors for the observed changes; to address the most urgent conservation actions. Published sources and field surveys made between March and July were used to assess number of breeding pairs of the commonest waterbirds in 1990–1992, 2000–02 and 2012–14. The breeding waterbird community exhibited several changes in its structure, with an overall positive trend; the number of species increased from 14 to 25 and the mean yearly abundance increased from 6155 to 14,008 pairs. The diversity (H′) increased slightly, whereas similarity indices and {nMDS} ordination both highlighted clear differences between 1990 and 1992 and 2012–2014 communities. The increase in richness and abundance were mostly due to the immigration of birds from nearby wetlands, to the partial recovery of lagoon ecological conditions since the end of the 1980s and to the occurrence of suitable man-made habitats, such as fish farms, dredge islands and a constructed wetland. The fraction of the population nesting at artificial sites and fish farms increased from 50\% in 1990–1992 till 80\% in 2012–2014, highlighting the importance of artificial breeding sites in costal lagoons. At the opposite natural nesting habitats, such as saltmarshes and beaches are losing importance for breeding waterbirds, thus requiring urgent conservation measures.},

This review contains a comprehensive comparison of results of these studies, describes the patterns in bird population trends in North America and Europe in last forty years and discusses potential drivers. I omitted other sources of bird population trend estimates to reduce methodological bias and because bird monitoring studies are rarely represented in other parts of the world. The most intensively studied driver is habitat alteration on breeding grounds represented by agricultural intensification in Western Europe and North American grasslands, forest expansion and land abandonment in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe and parts of North America, and more localized urbanization and forest habitat fragmentation. Evidence for climate change impacts is robust and includes almost all European regions covered by the reviewed studies but the causal mechanisms of its influence on bird abundance are not sufficiently known. Population limitation by environmental changes in wintering quarters is well supported by the studies covering 1970s and 1980s, whereas the effects of migration strategy became less important from 1990s onwards. Support for other potential drivers, such as direct disturbance by humans, is rather limited and further studies are needed to confirm their effects.},

	abstract = {Recent declines of many European bird species have been linked with various environmental changes, especially land-use change and climate change. Since the intensity of these environmental changes varies among different countries, we can expect geographic variation in bird population trends. Here, we compared the population trends of bird species among neighbouring countries within central Europe (Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland) between 1990 and 2016 and examined trait-associations with population trends at both national and international scales. We found that Denmark had the highest proportion of declining species while Switzerland had the lowest. Species associated with farmland had negative trends, but the effect size tended to differ among countries. A preference for higher temperature was positively associated with population trends and its effect size was similar among countries. Species that were increasing across all four countries were associated with forest; while species that were decreasing across all countries were long-distance migrants or farmland birds. Our results suggest that land-use change tends to be a more regionally variable driver of common bird population trends than climate change in central Europe. For species declining across all countries, international action plans could provide a framework for more efficient conservation. However, farmland birds likely need both, coordinated international action (e.g. through a green agricultural policy) to tackle their widespread declines as well as regionally different approaches to address varying national effect trajectories.},

	abstract = {Recent major environmental changes could lead to homogenization in the composition of plant and animal communities, with generalist species replacing more specialized species, as well as to the increased domination of species adapted to warmer climatic conditions. Using common bird monitoring data, we have tested whether these patterns can be observed in the long-term changes in the structure and species richness of bird communities in the Czech Republic. We focused on a comparison of two time periods (1982–1990 and 1991–2004) that differ in land use (high agricultural intensity in the former, and a drop in agricultural intensity accompanied by forest expansion in the latter). We found that bird communities became less specialized and that this decline in specialization did not change after 1990. In contrast, taxonomic homogenization increased during the first time period but declined at the beginning of the second one. Moreover, the community composition developed towards a dominance of species breeding in warmer climates, and this change coincided with an increase in spring temperatures. Therefore, it would appear that both functional and taxonomic homogenization took place in the 1980s but the latter did not continue in subsequent decades. Species richness of local bird communities did not show any trend over time. We suggest that climate warming might be an important driving force of changes in the bird community composition in the Czech Republic, but the role of land-use changes is less clear, although it is probable that habitat specialists probably did not benefit from lower intensity of agricultural activities and increased forest cover.},

	abstract = {Aim To determine the major patterns of change in avian diversity structure over space and time at a local resolution and continental extent in non-urban areas in North America. Location The contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods We used 1673 North American Breeding Bird Survey ({BBS}) routes containing 547 terrestrial and aquatic species to estimate four diversity components: species richness, individual abundance, taxonomic distinctness and species evenness. We implemented three levels of analysis to examine changes in diversity structure on a yearly basis from 1968 to 2003: (1) a canonical analysis of discriminance, (2) a univariate analysis across {BBS} routes, and (3) a univariate analysis at individual {BBS} routes. We estimated changes in similarity in species composition over time between 470,730 {BBS} route pairs. We also estimated the level of human activity at {BBS} routes using three spatial anthropogenic databases. Results {BBS} routes were located in non-urban areas in association with low nighttime light activity and moderately low human population densities. The analysis of diversity structure indicated the presence of two independent patterns: (1) a temporally consistent pattern defined by increasing species richness (12\% increase from 1968 to 2003) associated with limited gains in taxonomic distinctness, and (2) an association between species abundance and evenness related to variability in abundance associated with the most abundant species. The similarity analysis indicated that {BBS} routes located closer to the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of the United States experienced the strongest patterns of homogenization of species composition. Main conclusions Our results suggest that avian diversity structure has changed at the local scale in non-urban areas in North America. However, there was no evidence for a consistent continent-wide pattern. Instead, the evidence pointed to the presence of regional factors influencing diversity patterns. This study provides a foundation for more detailed investigations of the spatiotemporal and taxonomic details of these general patterns.},

Using data collected for two successive national breeding bird atlases, changes in diversity were assessed at different spatial scales (local, regional and national) and among species characteristic for different landscapes (farmland, woodland, heathland, wetland, coastal habitats and urban habitats). National species richness, diversity and equitability had increased between the two atlas periods, with more species increasing than decreasing in range and abundance. Most species in the large groups of woodland and wetland birds showed positive trends, whereas most in the smaller groups of heathland, reed-breeding and meadow birds showed negative trends. However, findings varied between regions and localities. Increases in species richness occurred mainly in regions in the low-lying, western part of the country which were previously relatively poor in species. By contrast, species richness decreased in some previously species-rich regions in the eastern part of the country. This has resulted in a homogenization of breeding bird communities between regions. We advocate the conservation and restoration of regional identity as a priority for landscape planning in the Netherlands. We did not find a clear relation between species abundance and trends, although both rare and very abundant species tended to decrease on average.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring is important as it allows to prioritize research into the causes of declines and assessing the efficacy of conservation measures. Regional assessments are valuable, because conservation policies and management are often implemented on national and sub-national level. We analyzed data from the German Common Bird Monitoring for 1990–2018. We derived indices of population size using standard log-linear models, based on point counts and route territory mapping at up to 1200 plots annually. We summarized species trends by ecological trait groups. Among the 93 common breeding birds, farmland birds declined strongly, birds of settlements declined. Forest birds initially declined, but recovered after ca. 2010. Wetland birds increased strongly, albeit the number of species with data was low. Consistent declines were found in ground-nesting birds, granivorous and invertebrate (other than insect)-feeding birds. Trends of insectivorous birds were stable on average, but farmland insectivores declined strongly since the year 2000. Long-distance migrants showed more negative trends compared to short-distance migrants and resident species. Species with narrow habitat niche declined disproportionally. Trends over the entire period were more negative in common species in the dataset (with a German breeding population of {\textgreater} 50 K and {\textless} 1 M pairs). On the opposite, short-term trends were more negative in less common species ({\textless} 50 K pairs). Cold-adapted species showed largely negative, warm-adapted largely positive trends. Multi-species indicators showed no directional change (i.e., a change from decline to increase or vice versa) conditional on the inclusion or omission of single species, but the magnitude of change was affected in groups with low sample size. This suggests that efforts should be made to develop robust monitoring schemes for rarer species that are not covered by the analyses here. We conclude that conservation policies in Germany should aim at halting the worrying declines in ground-nesting, often insectivorous, farmland birds. The recovery of forest and wetland birds is encouraging, but future trends need to be monitored. Ongoing climate change will affect species directly (via their thermal niche) and indirectly (e.g., through more forest disturbance). Conservation strategies will, therefore, need to consider species adaptation to environmental and climate change, e.g., in better protected area connectivity and management.},

The effects of local processes, such as competition, can only be detected at appropriately small local scales, and are obscured by large samples that aggregate environmental heterogeneity. Relatively few ecological and evolutionary processes can be identified as uniquely regional in scale, and local processes are expected to produce regional-scale differences between regions that differ consistently in environmental conditions that affect local processes. The relative contributions of regional properties and local processes are hypothesized to vary predictably along certain environmental gradients, and to produce locally regulated patterns of species diversity at scales ranging from a few millimeters to the entire globe.},

We performed geostatistical analyses based on spatial autocorrelation – cokriging models – to interpolate estimated species richness over the entire country, providing an opportunity to predict species-rich areas. We further compared species richness obtained with this method to species and rarity richness obtained using a national atlas of breeding birds. Estimated species richness was higher in species richness hotspots identiﬁed by the atlas. Combining informations on rare species from Atlas and species richness estimates from sound sampling based schemes should help with identifying species-rich areas for various taxa and locating biodiversity hotspots to be protected as high conservation value areas, especially in temperate zones where diversity hotspots are likely to match centers of high species richness because of very few centers of true endemicity.},

	abstract = {The vision of Chandler (Chan) S. Robbins for a continental-scale omnibus survey of breeding birds led to the development of the North American Breeding Bird Survey ({BBS}). Chan was uniquely suited to develop the {BBS}. His position as a government scientist had given him experience with designing and implementing continental-scale surveys, his research background made him an effective advocate of the need for a survey to monitor pesticide effects on birds, and his prominence in the birding community gave him connections to infrastructure—a network of qualified volunteer birders who could conduct roadside surveys with standardized point counts. Having started in the eastern United States and the Atlantic provinces of Canada in 1966, the {BBS} now provides population change information for ∼546 species in the continental United States and Canada, and recently initiated routes in Mexico promise to greatly expand the areas and species covered by the survey. Although survey protocols have remained unchanged for 50 years, the {BBS} remains relevant in a changing world. Several papers that follow in this Special Section of The Condor: Ornithological Advances review how the {BBS} has been applied to conservation assessments, especially in combination with other large-scale survey data. A critical feature of the {BBS} program is an active research program into field and analytical methods to enhance the quality of the count data and to control for factors that influence detectability. Papers in the Special Section also present advances in {BBS} analyses that improve the utility of this expanding and sometimes controversial survey. In this Perspective, we introduce the Special Section by reviewing the history of the {BBS}, describing current analyses, and providing summary trend results for all species, highlighting 3 groups of conservation concern: grassland-breeding birds, aridland-breeding birds, and aerial insectivorous birds.},

	abstract = {As better phylogenetic hypotheses become available for many groups of organisms, studies in community ecology can be informed by knowledge of the evolutionary relationships among coexisting species. We note three primary approaches to integrating phylogenetic information into studies of community organization: 1. examining the phylogenetic structure of community assemblages, 2. exploring the phylogenetic basis of community niche structure, and 3. adding a community context to studies of trait evolution and biogeography. We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology, biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities, ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science.},

We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change.},
