# Outline {-}

Literature review about the link between biodiversity facets trends and spatial/temporal scales. 

The idea is to take every paper that talk about biodiversity trends (so far using just the species richness seems already a lot of paper) and to list **1)** which biodiversity metric they use **2)** which taxon/taxa they use, **3)** the spatial scale, **4)** the temporal scale and **5)** what is the dynamic (does the biodiversity metric increase/decrease/doesn't change over time/unclear).

Make a table of all these papers and `group_by(taxa) %>% order_by(spatial_scale | temporal_scale)`. Then see if for each taxa we can find a trend (a bit like in Chase *et al.* 2019 Oikos paper | Jarzyna *et al.* 2015 but here I am not making the analysis, just taking the analysis from papers). Best example found so far: Hill & Hamer 2004 (https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00926.x)

I am using the "Advanced Research" tab of Web of Science which allows me skim through the entire literature using a convenient syntax. For instance:

```
AB = ((biodiversity OR species richness OR diversity) AND
(temporal trend* OR dynamic*) AND
(bird* OR avia*)) 
```

From this code, I could change the taxon.
