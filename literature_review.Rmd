# Outline {-}

Literature review about the link between biodiversity facets trends and spatial/temporal scales. 

The idea is to take every paper that talk about biodiversity trends (it could be either species richness, species diversity, colonization, extinction...) and to list **1)** which biodiveristy metric they use **2)** which taxon/taxa they use, **3)** the spatial scale, **4)** the temporal scale and **5)** what is the dynamic (does the biodiversity metric increase/decrease/doesn't change over time).

Make a table of it and `group_by(taxa) %>% order_by(spatial_scale | temporal_scale)`. Then see if for each taxa we can find a trend (a bit like in Chase *et al.* 2019 Oikos paper | Jarzyna *et al.* 2015 but here I am not making the analysis, just taking the analysis from papers).
